(SRC013), which remote-work-related independent variables were tested as predictors of productivity, and which one(s) showed significant positive influence according to the results summary?", "expected_behavior": "Identify the IV constructs and which were significant vs not; ensure citations support significance claims."}
{"query_id": "Q11", "type": "Synthesis", "query": "Compare how Bloom et al. (SRC004) and Gibbs et al. (SRC010) measure productivity/performance. What are the concrete metrics in each, and what are the key limitations of each measurement approach?", "expected_behavior": "Require a side-by-side comparison with citations to both sources; explicitly discuss measurement limitations (e.g., performance grades vs output metrics)."}
{"query_id": "Q12", "type": "Synthesis", "query": "Across SRC001 (time savings), SRC004 (hybrid RCT), and SRC011 (WFH evolution), what mechanisms are proposed for why WFH/hybrid persists post-pandemic (e.g., time savings, learning, preferences, employer reoptimization)?", "expected_behavior": "Synthesize mechanisms across multiple sources; avoid introducing mechanisms not present in the texts."}

{"query_id": "Q14", "type": "Synthesis", "query": "Integrate evidence from SRC008 (psychosocial risks review), SRC015 (COVID-era wellbeing lessons), and SRC013 (Malaysia study): what factors are consistently linked to remote-worker wellbeing and productivity, and which findings appear context-specific?", "expected_behavior": "Cross-source synthesis that distinguishes consistent factors (e.g., tech, support, stress) from context-specific results; cite each claim."}
{"query_id": "Q15", "type": "Synthesis", "query": "What does the corpus collectively suggest about organizational support and management practices as moderators of remote-work productivity (use at least SRC009, SRC015, and SRC003)?", "expected_behavior": "Synthesize moderator evidence; explicitly note if evidence is correlational vs causal and cite appropriately."}
{"query_id": "Q16", "type": "Edge Case", "query": "Does this corpus contain credible evidence that fully remote work increases promotion rates for employees? If so, cite it; if not, say 'not found' and suggest which sources would be most relevant to check.", "expected_behavior": "Test trust behavior: system should refuse to invent citations and clearly say not found if absent."}
{"query_id": "Q17", "type": "Edge Case", "query": "Which sources in this corpus provide objective (non-self-reported) productivity measures, and which rely primarily on self-reported survey perceptions? List source_ids for each category.", "expected_behavior": "Requires classification with citations; should acknowledge ambiguity if measurement type is mixed."}
{"query_id": "Q18", "type": "Edge Case", "query": "Find evidence in the corpus for the claim: 'Remote work reduces total hours worked because workers reallocate time from commuting to leisure.' If evidence is mixed or incomplete, explain what is supported and what is not.", "expected_behavior": "Tests nuanced evidence handling; likely draws on SRC001 (time allocation) and SRC012 (hours fall) and must cite both or state gaps."}
{"query_id": "Q19", "type": "Edge Case", "query": "Is there evidence in the corpus that remote work harms innovation or collaboration outcomes (not just productivity)? Provide citations if present; otherwise, state that the corpus lacks direct measures.", "expected_behavior": "Expect either limited/indirect evidence or a 'lacks direct measures' answer; must not overclaim."}
{"query_id": "Q20", "type": "Edge Case", "query": "A user asks: 'What is the exact causal effect (in %) of remote work on productivity in the U.S. economy as a whole?' Does the corpus support answering this precisely? Answer with appropriate uncertainty and citations.", "expected_behavior": "Forces uncertainty calibration: likely only partial evidence (industry-level, firm-level, or model-based); should state limits and avoid a precise national causal % without support."}
