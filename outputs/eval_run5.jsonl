The closest estimate of productivity change can be found in Table A6, where the productivity of office starters and remote starters are compared at different time points after the shift to remote work.\n\nFor office starters, the productivity is estimated to be 0.52* compared to the pre-lockdown level, while for remote starters, the productivity is estimated to be 1.26** compared to the pre-lockdown level. However, these estimates are based on a balanced panel and do not provide a clear picture of the productivity gain during the experiment.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a specific percentage gain in productivity for the 2015 Chinese experiment.

This suggests that remote work has increased in prevalence across industries since 2020.\n2. Industry-specific trends: The report also highlights industry-specific trends in remote work adoption. For example, in the IT sector, remote work is already common, while in the manufacturing sector, there has been a significant increase in remote work adoption (SRC003, Chunk 2).\n3. Shift towards permanent remote work: The report notes that there is a shift towards permanent remote work arrangements rather than just temporary arrangements (SRC003, Chunk 3). This suggests that remote work is becoming more established and integral to the way organizations operate.\n4.

This suggests that employees may have had less time and energy to devote to their work.\n2. Reduction in productivity: The study found that employee productivity decreased significantly during the pandemic, as measured by the number of tasks completed (SRC012, chunk_id=2). This suggests that employees may have been less focused or motivated during this time.\n3. Increase in errors and mistakes: The study found that there was an increase in errors and mistakes made by employees during the pandemic, as measured by a quality control metric (SRC012, chunk_id=3). This could be due to a decline in productivity or a decrease in employee attention and focus.\n4. Decrease in job satisfaction: The study found that employee job satisfaction decreased during the pandemic, as measured by surveys administered to employees (SRC012, chunk_id=4). This could be due to various factors related to the pandemic, such as increased stress or burnout.\n5. Increase in absenteeism: The study found that there was an increase in absenteeism among employees during the pandemic, as measured by attendance data (SRC012, chunk_id=5).
