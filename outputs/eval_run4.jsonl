Specifically, the study analyses the role of organisational support, technology availability (i.e. access to required devices and digital infrastructure for effective job execution) and employee wellbeing towards employee’s productivity. the study also analysed the role of socioeconomic (such as nationality, gender, age, marital status and household income levels) as a moderator between these variables. i n addition, the study analysed whether worker preference mediates the relationship between RW and employee productivity. Results showed technology’s availability significant positive influence, while organisational support had a positive but insignificant impact. employee well-being is strongly correlated with productivity. Socioeconomic profiles had no clear impact, but self-preference (SP) mediated effects. the findings imply that RW can increase employees’ productivity but organisations must be willing to invest in technology (to ensure it is readily available and accessible, foster supportive environments and align practices with individual preferences. 1. Introduction the world has been transformed by the coViD-19 outbreak, ushering in new social expectations and ways of living. coViD-19, a highly contagious and deadly virus, has prompted a shift in the standard operating procedures of businesses, making work-from-home (WFh) the new norm ( anakpo et al., 2023 ; oecD, 2020). WFh is an employment arrangement wherein employees are not obligated to physically attend a centralised workplace, such as an office building, warehouse or retail shop ( anakpo & Mishi, 2022 ; gqoboka et al., 2022 ; Kniffin et al., 2021 ). instead, they work from their homes or any offsite loca - tion (remote work [RW]), maintaining communication with colleagues and fulfilling responsibilities through telephone, email and virtual conferences (telework [ tW]). c ompanies are increasingly facilitating RW for various reasons, such as reducing office rental expenses, enhancing work–life balance, saving on travel time and opening up the possibility of accessing specialist talent across borders ( thorstensson, 2020 ). as the coViD-19 pandemic shifted from acute to endemic, many firms appeared to embrace or, at the very least, accept this ‘new normal’ and began implementing formal flexible work policies (Makarius et al., 2021 ). © 2025 the a uthor(s).

S. W. liM et al. Working from home including the lack of supervision, could lead to conflicts. the downsides encom - pass the potential for a monotonous and uninspiring work environment, along with the challenge of establishing clear boundaries between work and leisure time. these disadvantages may contribute to workplace stress, subsequently affecting productivity as measured by the company’s performance met - rics ( anakpo et al., 2023 , gibbs et al., 2021 ). communication, coordination and collaboration as more challenging in a virtual work setting, posing a significant obstacle to WFh, especially in roles where these elements are crucial, particularly for less-experienced employees. WFh has been shown to have both positive and negative impacts on productivity, contingent on factors, such as skills, education, tasks or industry ( gibbs et al., 2021 ; Kitagawa et al., 2021 ). as the coViD-19 pandemic shifted from acute to endemic, many firms appeared to embrace or, at the very least, accept this ‘new normal’ and began implementing formal flexible work policies (Makarius et al., 2021 ). Recent reports from the business sector have highlighted a resurgence of resistance from managers, exemplified by figures like elon Musk of tesla (Berger, 2023 ) and Jeff Bezos of a mazon (Kay, 2023 ), who have expressed concerns about productivity challenges in managing a remote workforce (Kelly, 2023 ). additionally, research that initially indicated increased productivity by the new remote workforce during and immediately after the coViD-19 pandemic lockdowns has since revealed updated findings suggest - ing a decline in productivity following the initial upswing (Bureau of labor Statistics, 2023 ). therefore, the question arises: Does the implementation of work flexibility or RW indeed lead to changes in worker productivity? c an we identify and quantify the factors that contribute to improvements or deterioration in outcomes, particularly within the context of the Malaysian workforce, encompassing both the current and emerging scenarios? a ddressing these questions goes beyond advancing the research field; it also plays a crucial role in assisting policymakers, employee unions, employees and organisations in planning and understanding the costs and benefits associated with the WFh strategy. While there is existing research on ‘remote work and productivity’ no empirical studies have presented a comprehensive model considering the many direct and indirect influencing factors and indicators, especially within the context of Malaysia. a lthough some research has covered the Malaysian workforce (hashim et al., 2020 ; tumin, 2020 ), it either took a singular sector focus or adopted a simplistic model that does not break down the ‘remote work’ construct. these limiting considerations do not adequately facilitate in-depth discussions around policy, intervention programmes or defining clear steps to move forward with this concept. Despite the presence of research on ‘remote work and productivity, ’ there is a gap in empirical studies presenting a comprehensive model that considers the myriad of direct and indirect influencing factors and indicators, particularly within the context of Malaysia. While certain research has addressed the Malaysian workforce (hashim et al., 2020 ; tumin, 2020 ), it either focused exclusively on a particular sector or utilised a simplistic model that does not dissect the ‘remote work’ construct. these limitations hinder the ability to engage in thorough discussions about policy, intervention programmes, or the formulation of clear steps to progress with this concept. the findings conclude that independent variables (iVs) of technology availability and accessibility and employee well-being have impacts on employee productiv - ity, however, no similar evidence is profound for organisation support. the subsequent sections of the research are structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology employed for the review. the findings are detailed in Section 3 , followed by discussions on these results in Section 4 . Finally, Section 5 concludes the research with recommendations and an acknowledgement of study limitations. 2. Literature review the commonly used term in discussions about the history and concept of RW, also known as WFh, is ‘telecommuting. ’ NaSa engineer Jack Nilles is credited with coining the term in 1973, a time when tele - phones were the primary tools enabling certain jobs, like telemarketers and call centre staff, to work remotely ( gupta, 2020 ). Nilles later refined his definition to describe telecommuting as ‘working outside the conventional workplace and communicating by way of telecommunications or computer-based tech - nology’ (Nilles, 1994 ). however, in contemporary discussions, terms such as ‘working remotely, ’ ‘work-from- home (WFh)’ or simply ‘remote work’ are more commonly preferred ( gupta, 2020 ). cogeNt Social ScieNceS 3 Within the broader concept of RW, literature explores into sub-concepts, such as ‘remote work inten - sity, ’ measured by the frequency of allowed remote workdays per week ( apsalone et al., 2017 ; Phillips, 2020 ). Various sub-concepts related to facilitation factors for effective RW have also emerged. a logical categorisation groups these factors into three broad categories: (1) the firm’s perspective, including WFh policies and support programmes; (2) intermediary considerations, encompassing the remote working environment and digital infrastructure; and (3) the employee, covering mental and physical well-being, attitude, and maturity. in this study, the focus is the impact of RW on employee’s productivity. From the outset of this research, the recurrent argument against implementing RW policies by organisations revolves around the potential negative impact on productivity. this concern gains credibility in the context of Malaysia, where productivity levels have remained stagnant, reaching only 37.1% of the regional leader, Singapore ( aSeaN & aSeaN, 2021). Productivity, commonly defined as the ratio between output and input, serves as a measure of efficiency, with input encompassing labour and capital and output representing the main goods or services produced ( oecD, 2001 ). Productivity plays a pivotal role, accounting for a significant portion of the measurable gDP per capita differences among global economies (Nayyar et al., 2021 ). Slow productivity growth in developing countries is identified as a major impediment to catching up with their developed counterparts (Maloney, 2021 ). the ‘Regional Study on labour Productivity in aSeaN’s report ( aSeaN & aSeaN, 2021) underscores the region’s growth strategy focused on improving labour productivity. this productivity, which grew by an average of 3% annually from 1971 to 2018, is analysed with Singapore’s leadership attributed to total factor productivity ( tFP) increases and capital accumula - tion. however, the report warns that the primary driver of this productivity growth is a capital increase, emphasising the importance of factors like capital deepening ( aSeaN & aSeaN, 2021). given the research’s interest in employee productivity, the focus narrows to labour quality within labour productivity. examining Malaysia’s decomposed labour productivity factors reveals that capital deepening has been a significant contributor, but the nation’s labour productivity growth rates are comparable to only half of its peers. Notably, in recent periods, Malaysia has lagged not only in overall growth but especially in labour quality growth ( aSeaN & aSeaN, 2021). While focusing into Malaysia’s national labour quality is beyond the research’s scope, the imperative for a comprehensive national framework addressing labour competitiveness, including the impact of changes in work practices like remote working on work quality and productivity, is evident. a review of the literature highlighted that there are many factors related to RW that impact employ - ee’s productivity. For example, Pradnya et al. ( 2024 ) studied impact of work environment, peer support, work satisfaction and organisational support on remote working productivity while a l-Dmour et al. ( 2023 ) found organisational, individual, technological and client-related factors influenced employee’s productiv - ity. elsewhere, Rüdinger (2024) in his thesis highlighted that internet quality, the desire to continue RW post pandemic and the presence of a dedicated home office room have a major impact on both employ - ee’s productivity and efficiency. the literature examining the relationship between RW and productivity has predominantly relied on self-reporting by employees, often comparing WFh to work-from-office (WFo ) setups. Studies by austin-e gole et al. ( 2020 ), allen et al. ( 2015 ), chung and van der lippe ( 2018 ) and Dockery and Bawa (2014 ) are examples employing such methods. While Malaysia-specific studies in this vein exist, they are generally confined to single organisations, particularly in academia and during the pandemic. on the quantitative side, a notable study by Bloom et al. ( 2015 ) focused on 249 employees in a chinese call centre. however, the industry-specific nature of call centres, which inherently capture specific productiv - ity parameters, limits the applicability of such models to other industries or job roles. a model presented by the organisation for e conomic c o-operation and Development ( oecD) in the report ‘Productivity g ains from teleworking in the post- coViD-19 era: how c an Public Policies Make i t happen?’ ( oecD, 2020) stands out for its comprehensive approach. this model advocates for the struc - tural adoption of RW across countries, sectors and occupations. i t suggests policies to overcome cultural and legal obstacles, stimulate infrastructure investments and outline best practices for private sector stakeholders. the oecD model incorporates two channels: (1) cost reduction at the firm level and (2) increased efficiency at the employee level, with both contributing to defining organisational productivity. the right channel posits that RW increases worker satisfaction, thereby enhancing efficiency, while the 4 B. S. W. liM et al. left channel claims that better firm performance results from cost reductions associated with RW. the report introduces the concept of a ‘sweet spot’ between remote working and worker efficiency, acknowl - edging the possibility of an inverted-U relationship without quantifying the specific threshold ( oecD, 2020). the aSeaN labour productivity study ( aSeaN & aSeaN, 2021) introduced a productivity model, although it does not address RW. this model identifies determinants of human capital productivity, emphasising factors beyond human capital quality, including deployment, utilisation, market policies and motivation by ‘gainsharing. ’ comparing the two models, this research adopts and adapts the oecD model, focusing on the worker channel (increased efficiencies) while assuming cost-savings on the firm side through effective RW poli - cies. this decision is driven by the model’s broad applicability across economic sectors and industries and its compatibility with the identified constructs in this research. the adapted model incorporates worker factors, influencing factors of RW and organisational support, providing a logical structure for future supplementary research covering the firm perspective. the adapted model simplifies the focus on human capital productivity, assuming all other factors are equal and constant. the chosen constructs of this research align with the original oecD model, with the ‘manager’ replaced by the ‘organization, ’ encompassing policies, programmes, training and financial support. the combined reduction in the ‘cost of doing business’ and increased ‘satisfaction’ influence labour productivity, considering capital, tFP and human capital (workers) ( aPo , 2018 ). in summary, the existing research on RW and productivity reveals four key gaps: (1) treating RW as a singular variable without breaking it down into specific facilitating or impeding factors; (2) overlooking the effects of socio-economic backgrounds on RW capabilities; (3) lacking correlation regarding the extent of an employee’s self-preference (SP) to work and its impact on RW; and (4) insufficient coverage of all relevant job functions across all sectors of corporate Malaysia. Based on the literature, this study focussed on three iVs: organisational support, technology availabil - ity and well-being. the first construct evaluates organisational responses to RW from the employee’s perspective, encompassing clarity of the organisation’s RW policy, both soft (e.g. training) and hard (e.g. tools and funding) support and subjective areas like social support programmes. the organisational sup - port theory ( oSt ) and perceived organisational support (PoS) are common references in the literature. eisenberger et al. ( 2020 ) and errichiello and Pianese ( 2021 ) both found organisational support influences productivity. When employees perceive that their organisation values their contributions and cares about their well-being, they demonstrate higher engagement and motivation (eisenberger et al., 2020 ). Support, such as regular feedback, mentoring and training reduces obstacles, enabling employees to perform efficiently. thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H1: organisation support has a strong impact on employee productivity. the next construct, technology availability, refers to access to required devices and digital infrastruc - ture for effective job execution. literature explores the correlation between digital technology access and RW effectiveness, considering perspectives from managers (Urbaniec et al., 2022 ), focusing on diversity, equality and inclusion (Russell & Frachtenberg, 2021 ), and defining technology types for effective RW (ilag, 2021 ). a survey by Universiti tun hussein onn (UthM) emphasises the importance of technology for Malaysian employees in the physical consulting industry (Suratkon & a zlan, 2021 ). Following this, the following hypothesis is developed: H2: technology availability has a medium effect on employee productivity. Measuring well-being, a construct not directly observable, requires translation into measurable vari - ables. the self-reporting subjective approach, recommended by the i nternational labour organisation (ilo ) and oecD, involves the individual’s self-perception of well-being. a dapting the a llostatic l oad framework from studies like ‘Work Stress and employee health: a Multidisciplinary Review’ ( ganster & Rosen, 2013 ) is a recurring conceptual approach to measure well-being. the framework distinguishes between physical (physiological) and mental (psychological) well-being ( ganster & Rosen, 2013 ; Mce wen & Stellar, 1993 ). employee well-being directly impacts focus, creativity and resilience. Poor mental or physical health leads to absenteeism, burnout and reduced productivity. organisations that prioritise well-being through flexible work arrangements (such as RW) enable employees to maintain a healthy cogeNt Social ScieNceS 5 work-life balance, which is essential for sustained productivity ( olawale et al., 2024 ). hence, the following hypothesis was developed: H3: Wellbeing has a profound influence on employee productivity. turning attention to the worker or employee, it is crucial to acknowledge the multitude of human factors contributing to each individual’s uniqueness. While outside the social science research domain, certain ‘softer-side’ factors are worth considering in understanding RW relationships with productivity. Past and recent studies suggest that the socio-economic profile of the worker can influence their effec - tiveness while working remotely. For instance, a study conducted in i taly identifies five types of remote workers, with those from higher socio-economic backgrounds, having more experience with RW, better technology access and higher-paying jobs, being the most effective (Donati et al., 2021 ). considering socio-economics, defined as the ‘interplay between social processes and economic activity within a society, ’ raises questions about its impact on a worker’s ability to effectively RW, potentially moderating effects on productivity. examples include working mothers lacking nearby family support for childcare, demographics in smaller homes hindering effective remote working, and other community and environmental factors distracting remote workers. the lower-income demographic’s environment can exacerbate general health issues related to prolonged RW, such as isolation, sedentary lifestyles, bad ergonomics and stress (h inge health, 2020 ). the concept of trust-based working time ( tBW t), introduced earlier, expands beyond organisational trust to encompass the current and potential talent pool’s prefer - ence for flexible work options. this SP to work acknowledges the myriad justifications for flexibility, rang - ing from family commitments to the changing characteristics of the g eneration Z workforce. tBW t, involving structural changes in measuring work productivity, shifts the focus from fixed work hours to the quality and sustainability of work. this construct offers insights into understanding how external factors can influence a worker’s productivity in different work settings. therefore, h4, h5 and h6 were developed. H4: Socio-economic profile influences the relationship between organisational support and employee productivity. H5: Socio-economic profile affects the relationship between technology availability and employee productivity. H6: Socio-economic profile moderates the relationship between well-being and employee productivity. Finally, the research incorporates the concept of SP to work as a mediating variable. While outside the social science research domain, considerations of socioeconomic factors, trust and engagement play cru - cial roles in understanding the complex interplay between RW and productivity (Donati et al., 2021 ; Fernandez et al., 2023 ). Worker preference arbitrates the relationship between RW and employee produc - tivity (iWg, 2022 ; Pwc, 2022 ) hence the following hypothesis was developed: H7: Worker preference arbitrates the relationship between RW and employee productivity. Based on the discussion, the following framework is developed and serves as a guide for exploring the complex interplay between these variables and their collective impact on the productivity of remote workers. the conceptual framework is depicted below, as in Figure 1 . 3. Methodology this study adopts a basic research approach, specifically designed as explanatory research, to investigate the fundamental aspects. the primary aim is to address gaps in current knowledge regarding the cause-and-effect relationship between various RW factors and employee productivity. Utilising a quanti - tative approach through an employee survey methodology, the research incorporates structured expert interviews with human resource practitioners, peers and university faculty members for design inputs. this study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards, and approval was obtained from the ethics c ommittee, University Malaya-Wales. a ll participants in this study gave informed consent before 6 B. S. W. liM et al. taking part. they were thoroughly informed about the study’s purpose, procedures and any potential risks or benefits. Verbal consent was obtained, ensuring that participants were aware of their rights, including the option to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. a dditionally, all collected data were anonymised to safeguard participant privacy. Verbal consent allows them to partici - pate in this study without the fear of leaving a written record. Data collection involves a survey administered on SurveyPlanet.com and structured expert interviews conducted virtually or face-to-face. the expert panel consists of six people consisting of three human Resource practitioners, two academics and one person with RW experience. they all agreed that the constructs and items of the questionnaire reflects the true nature of the construct. thus, ensuring the validity of the constructs. the questionnaire used the likert scale (1–7) – with 1 being the lowest in strength and 7 being the strongest expression of agreement – is employed for the quantitative instru - ment, with rigorous development and validation processes. the target population is specific to relevant working profiles in Malaysia, incorporating criteria such as experience in both WFo and WFh settings, Malaysian citizenship or permanent residency. a s there is no database available to form a sampling frame, a database consisting of 1000 names fulfilling the criteria was created through social and professional networks. Subsequently, respondents in the list were approached and invited to participate in the survey. the process was repeated until a total of 125 responses agreed to participate. a lthough this may lead to selection bias, the biasness was reduced as blind selection method was adopted whereby the researchers were unaware of the par - ticipant’s traits (e.g. age and socioeconomic status). i n addition, at a firm level – respondents may belong to any industries except for micro-enterprises and government/public sector employees – defined as sales turnover that is less than RM300,000 oR with full-time employees of less than 5 (BNM, 2013), and those from the government or public sector knowing that as these firms are assumed to be less structured, volatile in work expectations or may not even have a traditional fixed-office. constructs in the employee survey are operationalised, breaking them down into descriptive areas for ranking by respondents. the socio-economic profile of employees and the SP to work are assessed through multiple-choice questions. three iVs related to remote working and a dependent variable (DV) of employee productivity are measured on a scale of 7. Details of each construct are summarised in table 1 as follows: the data analysis plan employs structural equation modelling (SeM), a multivariate statistical analysis technique allowing for the analysis of structural relationships and evaluation of multivariate causal rela - tionships. the plan incorporates descriptive statistical analysis, chi-square testing for categorical datasets, and partial least square SeM (PlS-SeM) analysis, chosen over aNoV a for multigroup analysis due to its prevalence in recent business research studies. o verall, this comprehensive research design aims to Figure 1.

Results 4.1. Descriptive analysis From an initial set of 125 completed surveys, only 105 responses were valid and analysed. Demographic analysis revealed a balanced gender distribution, with 55% millennials, 28% generation-X, 14% g eneration and 3% boomers. Regarding relationship status, 62% were married, 34% were single, and the remainder were reported as ‘others. ’ the distribution by household income (monthly, gross) was tabulated across Malaysia’s current national classification (DoSM, 2020) of household demographics of bottom-40% (B40 earning up to My R4,900), middle-40% (M40 earning between My R4,901 till My R11,000) and the top-20% (t20 earning upwards of My R11,001). household income distribution showed 18% in the B40 category, 31% in the M40 category and a majority in the t20 class. Worker profiles indicated that 69% worked Table 1. Summary of construct and operationalising areas.

Reliability test to assess the correlation between the various indicators used for each major construct, including both iVs and the DV, internal consistency testing was applied to the measurement model. this was done to guarantee that the survey metrics fairly represented the factors that were being examined. the following describes the particular testing protocols. a fter each measure was shown to be reliable (i.e. those that did not satisfy the requirements were eliminated), the study of the model concentrated on the core or direct links. this entailed investigating the basic connections between the single DV and the three iVs, which correspond to hypotheses 1–3. the analysis then went on to investigate these main associations concerning moderator effects (hypotheses 4–6) and mediator effects (hypothesis 7). the first stage com - prised a detailed analysis of survey results about the fundamental or direct relationships. the under - standing of how each iV, which is built from a group of indicators, affects the results of the DV is based on the core measurement model. a summary of the corresponding indicators for each concept along this set of direct relationship paths is given in table 2 . table 2 also describes the tested measures and analyses for cote hypothesis statement. the internal consistency test, conducted in two parts, aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement model. i n the first part, c ronbach’s alpha was utilised to gauge the scale reliability, with values ranging from 0 to 1. a c ronbach’s alpha value of 0.7 or higher is commonly considered satisfactory ( cortina, 1993 ). in this study, all constructs demonstrated c ronbach’s alpha values within the range of 0.844–0.913, surpassing the benchmark value of 0.7, as illustrated in Figure 2 . the second part of the internal consistency test examined the outer loadings, which indicate the con - tribution of each variable’s indicators to their respective constructs. table 3 presents the results of reli - ability tests for the DV and iVs. i ndicators with loadings of 0.7 or higher are deemed highly satisfactory (Sinkovics & ghauri, 2009 ; Vinzi et al., 2010 ). in the measurement model, three indicators exhibited load - ings below 0.7 and were consequently excluded from their respective constructs. these indicators included Table 2.

Pass 2 of the analysis involved conducting partial least squares structural equation modelling (PlS-SeM) on the final measure - ment model, focusing on the core relationships between the iVs and DV, excluding moderating and mediating effects. PlS-SeM was chosen due to its ability to handle complex causal relationships, includ - ing those involving latent variables. the resulting model, depicted in Figure 3 , provided p values and standardised coefficients for each relationship, which are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections. 4.3. PLS-SEM the outcomes derived from the PlS-SeM coefficients shed light on pivotal relationships within the con - ceptual framework. the assessment of organisational support and employee productivity yielded a p value of 0.09 and a standardised coefficient of 0.12, indicating a relationship that is not statistically sig - nificant compared to the other two constructs, namely access to digital infrastructure and employee Figure 2. internal consistency test results.

Despite the lack of statistical significance, the data direction suggests a contributively role in measuring employee productivity. this finding leads to the rejection of hypothesis h1. on the other hand, the evaluation of technology availability and employee productivity resulted in a significant p value of 0.029 and a standardised coef - ficient of 0.171, indicating a substantial 17% contribution to the productivity relationship. this finding aligns with hypothesis h2 and is consistent with empirical evidence discussed in previous literature. the notion that employees with better access to essential digital technology infrastructure and conducive RW environments would experience improved productivity outcomes is supported by this result. the exam - ination of employee wellbeing and productivity yielded a remarkable finding, with a p value of 0.00 and a standardised coefficient of 0.045, indicating a highly significant relationship. this suggests a substantial 53% contribution to productivity, supporting hypothesis h3. the particularly notable aspect of this result is the high coefficient, underscoring the importance of employee wellbeing in influencing productivity outcomes, especially in the context of RW. While existing literature generally supports the association between good wellbeing and enhanced productivity, previous research has not extensively explored the specific link between wellbeing and productivity in RW settings. the significant 53% contribution observed in this study suggests that among various factors, employee wellbeing emerges as a crucial consideration in designing interventions and strategies to improve productivity outcomes in RW scenar - ios. this finding aligns with prior studies suggesting that prolonged periods of RW or extended working hours may lead to adverse physical and mental health effects, consequently impacting productivity levels negatively ( golden, 2012 ; Sharpe & Fard, 2022 ). Notably, the prominence of employee wellbeing in the results may also indicate the recognition of its importance by remote workers themselves. Moving for - ward, the study examined the moderating variable’s influence on the three core relationships. this involved assessing how a worker’s socioeconomic background moderates the strength and direction of the relationships between various RW factors and productivity outcomes ( golden, 2012 ; Sharpe & Fard, 2022 ). Figure 3. iV to DV measurement model. (Source by a uthors). cogeNt Social ScieNceS 11 Following this, the moderating variable undergoes testing against each of the three core relationships. this selected moderator variable aims to examine the influence, both in terms of strength and direction, of an employee’s socio-economic profile on the relationships between each respective RW independent variable (iV) and their productivity outputs (see table 4 ). in the initial pass, which resembled previous assessments, the focus was on evaluating the internal consistency of the measurement model. Since the moderator construct consisted of only one measure – a categorical variable representing household income type – there was no need for an outer loading assessment. i f the income levels had not been categorised, the moderator would have been treated as a continuous variable instead (Basbeth et al., 2018 ). once the measurement model’s quality had been confirmed, the analysis shifted to examining the moderating effects of their strength and direction. again, PlS-SeM was utilised to determine significance and path coefficients, as depicted in Figure 4 . table 5 presents the results for the moderator constructs. the total effects of the results, as shown in table 5 , indicate insignificant outcomes for all moderated relationships, regardless of their form. the p values across all moderated relationships demonstrate this lack of significance. the PlS-SeM coefficient results indicate that the moderating effect of a worker’s socioeconomic pro - file on organisation support and employee productivity is not significant ( p value of 0.358). therefore, no further assessment is required, leading to the rejection of h4. Similarly, the moderating effect of a worker’s socioeconomic profile on technology availability and employee productivity is also insignificant (p value of 0.364), resulting in the rejection of h5. a dditionally, the moderating effect of a worker’s socioeconomic profile on employee wellbeing and employee productivity is found to be insignificant (p value of 0.647), leading to the rejection of h6. Finally, the mediating effect of ‘self-preference to work’ is tested across all relationships between iV constructs and DV. this mediator variable aims to examine how the relationship changes when a worker expresses a stronger desire to WFh versus WFo , or vice versa. essentially, the analysis seeks to understand how organisational support for RW, access to digital infrastructure and well-being affect RW productivity when factoring in an individual’s preference for WFh or WFo . this investigation explores whether strong preferences for one work mode influence the relationships differently compared to when preferences are not considered, as indicated by earlier findings.Table 4.

S. W. liM et al. Finally, the mediating effect of ‘self-preference to work’ was examined across all relationships between iV constructs and the DV. table 6 presents the measures for mediating hypothesis statements. the eval - uation indicated significant indirect effects on organisational support and employee well-being, while technology availability showed no mediation. Results for the SP to work mediator (WM) (h7) demon - strated a significant indirect effect between the mediator and DV ( p value 0.039). Notably, the examina - tion of the mediator’s SP for work reveals a significant indirect effect on the DV in pathway p2 ( p value 0.039). c ontrarily, the indirect effects in pathway p1, connecting the iVs to the mediator, exhibit varying results. Specifically, iV1 and iV3 display significance, whereas iV2 emerges as statistically insignificant (refer to table 6 ). consequently, in the topmost level of the flowchart, iV1 and iV3 are directed left, while iV2 is positioned to the right. the process of testing the mediating effects involves a series of tests and analyses applied to the earlier core or direct relationships. Similar to previous assessments, the first step is to evaluate the inter - nal consistency of the measurement model. Unlike before, no outer loading assessment is necessary in this case because the mediator construct consists of only one measure. once the quality of the measure - ment model has been confirmed, the mediating effects are analysed for their type and strength. a gain, the significance and path coefficients are derived using the PlS-SeM methodology (see Figure 5 ). table 7 shows the full evaluation of mediating effects. the results from the PlS-SeM coefficients indi - cate that the indirect effect (pathway p2) between the mediator, SP to work, and the DV is significant, with a p value of 0.039. however, the indirect effects (pathway p1) between the iVs and the mediator show different outcomes, with iV1 and iV3 being significant while iV2 is not (see table 7 ). as a result, iV1 and iV3 are directed to the left, while iV2 is directed to the right at the topmost level of the flowchart.Table 5.

Figure 4. Moderator measurement model. (Source by a uthors). cogeNt Social ScieNceS 13 Upon assessing the next level of the flowchart, it is found that the direct relationship (p3) of h1 is not significant, whereas h2 and h3 are significant, as discussed earlier. this leads to the conclusion that the SP to work construct fully mediates the relationship between organisational support iV and produc - tivity DV, partially mediates the relationship between employee well-being iV and productivity DV, and does not mediate the relationship between access to digital infrastructure iV and productivity DV. in essence, the mediating analysis indicates that individuals’ SP for work will have a predominant influence, overshadowing any organisational support provided (or lacking) to employees, while it disre - gards any direct causality between access to digital infrastructure and productivity outcomes. Regarding employee wellbeing, SP will only partially alter the way individuals engage in RW. this conclusion is Table 6. Measures tested and analysed for mediating hypothesis statement.

W. liM et al. consistent with the statistical trends and logical interpretation of the relationships between all three iVs and the DV. therefore, h7 receives support from these findings. to conclude, the hypotheses proposed at the beginning of this study underwent thorough examina - tion, resulting in diverse findings. the summarised outcomes for each hypothesis are presented in table 8 . in brief, the hypotheses produced a range of results. organisational support (h1) was not sup - ported, whereas technology availability (h2) and employee well-being (h3) were validated. Socioeconomic profile exhibited no significant moderating effects (h4, h5 and h6), while worker preference was observed to mediate the relationships in distinct ways (h7). according to Werbeloff ( 2023 ), the core components of research, including aims, questions, and objec - tives, should remain interconnected from inception to conclusion, forming a cohesive narrative. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between RW and employee productivity, with a focus on uncovering causal links across various constructs identified through the literature review process. a t its broadest level, the goal was to contribute to discussions on optimising RW practices for organisations, challenging the prevalent assumption that productivity decreases with RW and advocating for progres - sive workforce environments in Malaysia. the research objectives were successfully achieved. these objectives included establishing a framework for assessing RW’s impact on productivity, identifying rele - vant variables impacting employee productivity in RW settings, defining measurement models for these variables, and examining how workers’ backgrounds, environments or profiles influence their productivity.Table 7.

Further analysis revealed that individual tasks were more efficiently performed in remote settings, while administrative, collaborative and communication tasks were better executed in office environments. Despite the confir - mation of reduced overall productivity in RW settings, the study provided valuable insights. First, it con - firmed the permanence of RW as a trend, driven by factors such as work-life balance considerations and shifts in workforce demographics. Second, it highlighted the tangible benefits of flexible work arrange - ments for organisations, such as access to a broader talent pool. third, it identified actionable areas for improvement to mitigate productivity challenges associated with RW. the study identified organisational support, access to digital infrastructure and employee well-being as key factors influencing remote work - ers’ productivity. While organisational support and employee well-being significantly impacted productiv - ity, access to digital infrastructure did not show a significant effect. these findings suggest that policymakers and organisations should prioritise support for employee well-being and organisational initiatives. Furthermore, the analysis explored the role of socioeconomic profiles and SP to work as potential moderators and mediators. a lthough the moderating analysis yielded insignificant results, the mediating analysis revealed significant effects of well-being and organisational support on productivity through SP to work. lastly, the study shed light on the perceived benefits of RW, such as increased focus, flexible scheduling for work-life balance and reduced commute times. c ollaboration was identified as the primary benefit of working from the office, followed by work-life segregation and access to effective infrastructure. o verall, the study met its objectives, offering valuable empirical evidence to enhance understanding in the underexplored domain of RW and productivity. the findings, particularly regarding worker well-being and SP to work, contribute significantly to the discourse on this topic, warranting further research continuation. 5. Conclusion this study, which involved stringent sample selection resulting in 105 accepted participants, comprised individuals evenly distributed across genders and representing various generations. Predominantly, the participants were married with household incomes above B40 and occupied desk-bound positions in large, multinational firms within the services sector. the research delved into the relationships between organisational support, technology availability, employee well-being and employee productivity. organisational support exhibited a positive but non-significant impact on employee productivity. this finding contradicts with the studies conducted by eisenberger et al. ( 2020 ) and errichiello and Pianese (2021 ). Future studies should explore this further. Nevertheless, the finding maybe as, such as the pop - ulation of the studies were not similar: eisenberger et al. ( 2020 ) study was conducted in the USa while errichiello and Pianese ( 2021 ) was based on a case study on an i talian it multinational. Both technology availability and employee well-being showed a positive and significant influence on employee productivity. this paper further delved into the moderating effect of socioeconomic profiles and the mediating effect of SP to work. Socioeconomic profiles were found not to moderate relationships between iVs and productivity. SP to work emerged as a mediator, influencing the relationship between organisational support and productivity and partially mediating the connection between employee well-being and pro - ductivity. this is supported by a braham Maslow’s ( 1943 ) proposition of the ‘hierarchy of needs, ’ empha - sising fulfilling innate human needs leading to self-actualisation (Maslow, 1943 ). Diverse research findings on WFo versus WFh productivity presented a nuanced perspective, leaning towards WFo . however, vari - able breakdowns challenge sweeping statements on either side. Recommendations include firms acknowledging the permanence of RW, adopting a hybrid approach, and investing in RW factors. Firms must provide effective organisational support, i.e. providing resources, assistance and care for employees to help them increase productivity. clear communication, training, equitable procedures, acknowledgement and emotional support are all part of this. employee well-being, motivation and job happiness are all improved by strong organisational support, which also increases overall performance and productivity. 16 B. S. W. liM et al. a shift towards measuring productivity based on output and trust is advised. For remote workers, engaging in open discussions with employers about preferences and recognising the importance of building trust over time is crucial. Understanding that managers prioritise productive output over the location and timing of work is emphasised. Policy recommendations urge policymakers to encourage and incentivise flexible work arrangements, address global talent retention challenges and consider pol - icies supporting the benefits of RW. one limitation of the study is the potential for sampling bias despite the stringent sample selection process. the participants were predominantly married individuals with household incomes above the B40 threshold, employed in desk-bound positions within large, multinational firms. this demographic compo - sition may not fully represent the broader population, particularly those in different socioeconomic brackets, employment sectors, or marital statuses. c onsequently, the findings may not be generalisable to a wider range of individuals, limiting the study’s external validity. one recommendation to address this limitation is to diversify the participant pool by actively recruiting individuals from various socioeco - nomic backgrounds, employment sectors and marital statuses. this can be achieved through targeted outreach efforts, such as partnering with organisations representing diverse demographics or utilising online platforms to reach a wider audience. By including a more diverse sample, the study can enhance its external validity and provide insights that are more applicable to a broader range of individuals. a second limitation of the study is the number of responses analysed: only 105. a lthough the number may not allow the findings to be generalised, future work could replicate with larger samples to validate the findings. additionally, conducting follow-up studies with different participant demographics can help validate and expand upon the findings. in addition, future studies should adopt the longitudinal approach as it would allow researchers to examine how organisational support, technology availability, employee well-being and productivity dynamics vary across different population segments over time. Besides that, future studies should incorporate qualitative research methods, such as interviews or focus groups, as the qualitative approach can provide deeper insights into the experiences and perspectives of partici - pants from diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, researchers should consider exploring potential cultural or contextual factors that may influence the relationships between the study variables. this could involve conducting cross-cultural studies to compare findings across different regions or countries, considering cultural norms, organisational practices and societal values. By considering these factors, the study can offer more nuanced recommendations that are sensitive to diverse cultural contexts and better inform organisational policies and practices. this study resulted in the creation of a suitable framework and measurement model that can be reused, or further developed, to advance the understanding of how to manage the RW megatrend that shall remain relevant for the current and foreseeable future. the findings imply that RW can increase employees’ productivity but organisations must be willing to invest in technology (to ensure it is readily available and accessible, foster supportive environments and align practices with individual preferences. adapting to the evolving workforce needs is crucial for successful RW implementation.

This paper systematically examines the impact of remote work on productivity across professions through a PRISMA - model literature review of studies from Scopus and Web of Science (2018–2023), with 46 papers selected after removing duplicates. Vocational psychology research initially showed enhanced work efficiency and reduced distractions at home, thou gh later findings revealed mixed productivity outcomes. While flexibility, shorter commutes, and autonomy boosted productivity, employees with children at home faced declines. Key findings highlight that isolation, burnout, and digital illiteracy during CO VID-19 further hindered productivity, with professors also experiencing cyberbullying from students. This review emphasizes productivity determinants for remote workers, though psychological impacts of working from home remain unaddressed.

(2021), the interconnection of humans with machines has been seen to increase in the era of digitalization. This has been a contributing factor in the movement in work culture away from the conventional office space and towards the culture of individuals working from home. As a result of the pandemic, the prevalence of distant work habits has grown. Employees and employers alike have been looking for alternate work arrangements as a consequence of this, particularly in light of the fast -paced conditions surrounding COVID -19. As a result of the COVID -19 outbreak, the broad adoption of remote work operations on a global scale was expedited. As a result of lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the requirement to protect employee safety, several companies have used remote work solutions. People\\'s perspectives have been altered as a result of the rapid change in the working environment, which has had an effect on the amount of work that is accomplished by people of different genders. Despite the fact that working from home is not a novel notion, there has been a growth in study in this field since the COVID -19 outbreak. Offices have begun to implement telecommuting as an alternative work arrangement, which enables employees to do their jobs from the comfort of their own homes. It has been reported by that the number of peop le working remotely in the United States has significantly increased by 159% between the years 2005 and 2017 (FlexJobs, 2019). The findings of a study that was conducted by Gartner in April 2020 revealed that seventy -four percent of chief financial officer s (CFOs) had plans to permanently move a portion of their personnel to work remotely. According to the results of the study an astounding 98% of respondents indicated that they have a strong inclinedness to continue working remotely for the whole of their careers, but with some degree of flexibility (Buffer, 2020) .According to Abujarour et al. (2021), organisations will apply a variety of techniques in order to improve the productivity of their employees and to provide a positive working environment. On the other hand, there are not many management practices that are geared towards the effectiveness and productivity of workers who work remotely or telecommute. One of the most important factors that has contributed to the success of remote work is the development of technology, namely the advent of collaboration platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack. When it comes to preserving productivity and connection among teams that are located in different parts of the world, cloud- based services and digital communication technologies are very necessary. There has been a convergence of difficulties and advantages brought about by the adoption of remote work. The challenges included problems with communication and teamwork, as well as difficulties striking a g ood balance between work and personal life. Increased flexibility, financial benefits for both companies and employees, and access to a larger pool of skilled personnel are some of the good aspects of this arrangement. Many companies are contemplating the implementation of hybrid work arrangements, which provide workers with the opportunity to do their jobs both from home and in the office. The purpose of this method was to achieve a condition of equilibrium and harmony between the benefits of working remotely and the advantages of working together in person. Previous studies that have been conducted to determine the effect that working remotely has on productivity have frequently been restricted in their scope or methodology, highlighting the importance of conducting a comprehensive and up- to-date investigation. There are a lot of assessments that are already out there, but they could have a restricted scope since they concentrate on particular fields, areas, or time periods. As a result, they do not adequat ely reflect the wider and ever -changing world of remote work that the Internet has brought about. Due to the continuous advancement of both technology and work processes, it is necessary to conduct a more up -to-date analysis, which may be lacking in earlier evaluations. In previous evaluations, there may have been a lack of suitable organised methods, which may have led to an inadequate Exploring the Impact of Remote Work on Productivity: A Systematic Review understanding of the various elements that influence production in distant places. The purpose of the proposed systematic review is to rectify these deficiencies and provide a complete and up-to-date synthesis of the investigations that have already been conducted. The extensive and increased usage of remote work during the COVID -19 epidemic gives us a unique chance to examin e the influence that it has on productivity. The purpose of this study is to provide a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the complicated link that exists between distant work and productivity. The sudden shift, which was prompted by worries about the state of global health, poses a challenge to conventional ideas about the dynamics of the job market. An inadequate grasp of the many elements that impact productivity in distant locations is the root cause of the research gap that has been identified. Occasionally, the study that is currently being conducted does not provide a comprehensive examination of the numerous aspects that are involved. These factors include technical infrastructure, organisational policy, and the well -being of staff. In order to fill this void, the purpose of this systematic review is to synthesise the research that has already been done, detect trends, and evaluate potential study techniques. In order to fill the gap in research, the purpose of this study is to offer insightful information to enterprises, governments, and academic institutions that are struggling to keep up with the ever -changing dynamics of remote labour. Following the epidemic, they will be able to adopt a more educated and deliberate approach to the professi onal context as a result of this. Now the main question arises: what is the impact of remote working on the work productivity of employees? The current study aims to analyse the results published on SCOPUS and the WoS databases on work- from -home productivi ty and its associated factors. Method The present systematic review followed the guidelines outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA). 1 Search Strategy In order to conduct a thorough investigation, a searc h strategy was formulated to identify pertinent scholarly literature. The search technique was modified to focus on two databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science (WoS ), and the following search terms were implemented to conduct the search: \"Work from home\" OR \"remote working\" OR \"telework* AND productivity* OR efficiency* limited to Title and abstract of the articles.\" \"Work from home\" OR \"remote working\" OR \"telework* \". All searches spanned from the year 2018 to 2023, and the selection criteria for the study encompassed scholarly articles and review papers that were exclusively published in the English language. 2 Inclusion and Exclusion criteria The PRISMA Declaratio n 2020 served as the foundation for the criteria used in the selection process. The primary objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of the available literature pertaining to the work -from -home (WFH) arrangement and its influence on work productivity within the domains of social sciences, environmental sciences, business, and economics. The search then limited the subject categories to multidisciplinary, social sciences, psychology, arts, and humanities fields. 2018 through 2023 were the scope of the search. Articles in the press were excluded, and the final papers published were selected for inclusion. S. Prasad, A . Arahant, A . Kaushik 53 Only research papers and review papers in journals were included, and conference papers or trade journals were excluded due to a lack of peer review. Finally, papers in the English language were adopted as the final inclusion criteria for the selection of papers in the database, and papers in other languages were excluded. 3 Quality Assessment The study is based on only original research papers and review papers. Out of 660 papers, 260 were included after filtration and exclusion criteria. In order to ensure the integrity of the review, a comprehensive examination was conducted to identify and eliminate any instances of duplication. A total of 12 duplicate files were eliminated from both databases. In order to uphold the standards of quality and pertinence in the evaluation procedure, a comprehensive examination and clarification of the abstract and title of the article were conducted. Later , a thorough examination of the research paper was conducted. Non- peer-reviewed papers were removed due to a lack of verification of the information in these papers. Furthermore, after filtration of duplicate records, more papers were removed as they did not show relevant information on work efficiency or productivity in the remote working environment. 46 papers were finally selected after manual screening that were related to work productivity during the work- from -home scenario. Exploring the Impact of Remote Work on Productivity: A Systematic Review Fig. 1 shows the literature inclusion and exclusion at every stage(PRISMA statement). Source: Author’s compilation 4 Data extraction During the data extraction phase, a total of 46 articles were selected for analysis. The relevant characteristics that wer e extracted from these articles were: 1. All articles must be either original research studies or reviews of previously published works. We did not include any published reports, conference papers, or trade publications in our analysis. 2. All of the articles mu st be written in English and pertain to some aspect of the arts, humanities, or social sciences. S. Prasad, A . Arahant, A . Kaushik 55 3. The articles that were extracted for analysis were published within the time frame of 2018 to 2023. 4. The articles that were extracted were restricted to searchi ng for keywords specifically in the Title and Abstract sections of the papers within the database. Results 1 Study characteristics One example of a visual depiction of the search results is shown in Figure 1. After deleting duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 660 records were evaluated to determine whether or not they were eligible, and each of the remaining 260 records was evaluated in its entirety to determine eligibility. For the purpose of data extraction, there were a total of forty -six studies, eight of which were qualitative and thirty -eight of which were quantitative. The information about filtered records that were released between the years 2018 and 2023 is displayed in Figure 2. The descriptive analysis of the works that fall under the ensuing topics is displayed in Figure 3. Although the remaining publications (n = 26) addressed both elements, 14 of these papers demonstrated the negative impact of work- from -home culture on work productivity, while 7 of these papers demonstrated the favourable impact of work- from -home culture on work productivity. Fig. 2: Year wise distribution of articles Source: Author’s compilation Exploring the Impact of Remote Work on Productivity: A Systematic Review Fig. 3: Number of articles in subthemes derived from PRISMA Source: Author’s compilation According to the findings of the research, working remotely has a mixed impact: it might improve organisational performance, but it could also reduce productivity at the group level. Managers are more likely to delegate tasks a nd have difficulties communicating. The satisfaction of faculty members increased with online education, but it was also plagued by cyberbullying. Distractions, stress, and gender discrepancies all contribute to a decrease in overall productivity while som eone is working remotely. Those who are most affected are people who are mothers. Productivity is increased by variables that contribute to well -being, such as the work environment, flexible hours, and autonomy. It is true that working from home is a productivity enhancer for certain people, but that is not the case for everyone. 2 Managerial decision and remote work culture In five separate studies, the influence of remote work on management decision- making was investigated, and the findings indicated both advantages and disadvantages. There were five articles that were relevant to the influence on the decisiveness of management during WFH, and these papers were finalised after being screened. According to the findings of the study (Choudhury et al., 2021), working remotely has resulted in a considerable improvement in the performance of the company. According to Okubo et al. (2021), although there was a decline in employee productivity at the group level, managers found that working from home may be beneficial. Effective remote workflow has been shown to have a beneficial impact, but technology -driven anxiety has been shown to have the opposite effect (Chow et al., 2022). According to Kumaresan et al. (2022), managers often exercise less power and delegate m ore tasks while dealing with pandemics. Before the downturn, communication channels and information technology platforms were able to tackle difficulties with productivity; however, problems with mutual trust, engagement, and motivation cannot be remedied remotely (Stoker et al., 2022). Nevertheless, managers are not the only ones who can make choices in the managerial realm. According to Kumaresan et al. (2022) and Okubo et al. (2021), it calls for prudence on the part of individuals, groups, and organisat ions together. The findings of this research, which was conducted with a sample size of 60 and a p<.005 when using PLS -SEM, reveal that working remotely has a substantial impact on the level of assistance provided by supervisors and the performance of empl oyees(Mardianah et al., 2020). S. Prasad, A . Arahant, A . Kaushik 57 3 Online education and productivity The complexity of the influence that remote education has on productivity is shown by the fact that while certain aspects, such as time flexibility and work -life balance, contributed to an increase in faculty efficiency, other issues, such as cyberbullying and distractions, also played a role. During the pandemic, it was revealed that there is a significant correlation between participation in remote schooling and increased production. According to Aczel et al. (2021), academicians and faculty members had a limited amount of time to transition to alternative employment arrangements. In higher education institutions, a reduction in the amount of time spent commuting, an improvement in eating habits, and a better work -life balance (WLB) all contributed to an increase in job satisfaction and efficiency (Chapman & Thamrin, 2020). Based on the findings of a study conducted by Kawakubo and Arata in 2022, it was found that school management support and family work conflict had a favourable correlation with teachers\\' efficiency during pandemics. On the other hand, the research conducted by Drašler et al. in 2021 revealed that technology choice did not have any associations with better efficiency. In contrast to the previous finding, one study (Irshad et al., 2021) provides evidence that technology has a positive influence on the productivity of employees who work from home. Ipsen et al. (2021) found that increased instances of cyberbullying among stude nts led to decreased levels of presenteeism and increased levels of burnout among instructors. According to the majority of articles, working from home has a negative influence on work productivity. This is mostly attributed to the distractions that arise from home needs, as stated by Shimura et al. (2021), Drašler et al. (2021), mental distortion (Seva et al., 2021), and poor motivational consequences (Martin et al., 2022). A recent study, which was carried out with a sample size of 403 and utilised struct ural equation modelling (SEM) analysis, discovered considerable evidence (P value <.005) that organisational, human, technical, and client -related elements had a significant and beneficial effect on academic productivity through staff participation. The significance of these findings lies in the fact that it is essential to take into account these interconnected factors in a comprehensive manner in order to improve productivity and engagement in academic work that is performed remotely(Al -Dmour et al., 2023). 4 Productivity Comparison While the majority of studies on remote work productivity have found a decrease in productivity due to distractions, technology overload, and specific job types, some studies have highlighted benefits such as geographical flexi bility and individual efficiency. This suggests that there is a nuanced picture with positive and negative aspects depending on individual and job- specific factors. The comparison of productivity is based on two different factors: the first factor is the time period before and after the pandemic (n = 1), and the second factor is the difference between work done on- site and work done off -site (n = 11). A number of studies have demonstrated that working remotely has a detrimental influence on job productivit y. These studies include those conducted by Nguyen (2021), Chatterjee et al. (2022), Prodanova and Kocarev (2022), Hafermalz and Riemer (2021), Rietveld et al. (2022), Rožman et al. (2021), Williamson et al. (2022), and Zurcher (1821). According to Nguyen (2021), low work from home productivity was caused by a combination of factors, including emotional concerns, distractions, and a bad home environment. The researcher discovered that the sort of research work that they are performing has an effect on the a mount of productivity that they have. According to Rietveld et al.\\'s research from 2022, the efficiency of data collecting and the exchanging of opinions among coworkers increased when they were away from the office, whereas the efficiency of literature re ading and data analysis rose when they were at home. According to Rietveld et al. (2022) and Rožman et al. (2021), researchers who worked with toddlers demonstrated a decrease in output.According to Chatterjee et al. (2022), the use of Exploring the Impact of Remote Work on Productivity: A Systematic Review digital tools contributed to an excessive amount of information load, which in turn led to stress on the job and, as a result, decreased job productivity around the house. During this time, the amount of work that developers are able to do is directly proportional to the size of the project that they are working on (Hafermalz& Riemer 2121). There has been no gain in employee production at Work from Home (WFH), although Work from Anywhere (WFA) demonstrated a 4.3% rise in productivity (Toscano &Zappalà, 2020). Geographical flex ibility is beneficial to individual work, but there has been no improvement at Work from Home. According to Williamson et al. (2022) and Zurcher et al. (2021), thirty -two percent of the working population saw a decline in their perceived productivity when they were working from home. According to Kuletto et al. (2021), vocational psychologists have seen that working from home leads to increased productivity and less distractions, which is in contrast to the findings of the research mentioned above. According to Okeke et al.\\'s research from 2021, employees with high wages and high levels of education had a relatively lesser decrease in their job productivity. Sixty -six percent of respondents said that working from home would be a great option in the future (Rietveld et al., 2022). 5 Role of Gender Diversity Research conducted prior to the pandemic revealed that there was no gender difference in terms of job productivity. However, studies conducted during remote work revealed a substantial decline for women, pa rticularly those who had children. This highlights a new gender disadvantage in the setting of working from home. Catană et al. (2022 did a study that suggested there was no substantial difference in work productivity between the sexes prior to the commencement of the pandemic. This research was completed before the epidemic began. On the other hand, a study of the relevant literature on this subject indicates that every single publication that was screened provides evidence that there is a considerable dif ference in the amount of work that is accomplished by men and women who work from home. According to Catană et al. (2022) and Ferreira et al. (2021), women have reported decreased job productivity at home, and this might have a detrimental impact on their production when the number of hours they work increases. Compared to male authors, female authors are more likely to be impacted. According to Galanti et al. (2021) and Irshad et al. (2021), male authors who do not have children are found to be the least impacted, while female authors who have children are shown to be the most affected when they are writing from home. 6 Human well -being and productivity A multifaceted role in remote work productivity is played by well- being, which encompasses elements like a nice work environment, flexible hours, and social connection. Well -being has an impact on different groups, including men, women, and specialised professions, in a variety of ways, with both positive and negative influences. According to Weitzer et al. (2021), the condition of being well and at peace with oneself is the definition of well -being. Productivity in the workplace is impacted by both physical and mental health. A better desk environment (Kazekami, 2020), suitable remote hours (Li et al., 2021), a feeling of belongingness (Nguyen, 2021), self -leadership, and autonomy (Giovanis, 2018) are some of the variables that contribute to the interconnection of aspects that improve human well -being. There are a number of factors that lead to low productivity at home, including psychological detachment (Awada et al., 2021), (Abujarour et al., 2021), occupational and parental stress (Bao et al., 2022), boredom and distraction (Mihalca et al., 2021), and boredom or distraction. Because they do not feel like they belong, men who do not have wives and children are more likely to experience burnout and stress while the y are working from home (Awada et al., 2021). To the contrary, men in their middle years experience 96% less burnout than women do in their same age range. When it comes to home productivity, women in the information technology field experience higher S. Prasad, A . Arahant, A . Kaushik 59 burnout than males in the field (Morikawa, 2022). A study conducted by Plaunova et al. (2021) found that a decrease in both physical and mental stress at home led to an increase in productivity for employees who worked from home. The stresses associated with w orking remotely have had a favourable impact on non- tourism academics; however, tourism scholars have not been influenced by these stressors (Seva et al., 2021). It is possible that the beneficial aspects of working remotely are connected to a number of di fferent issues, such as organisational and work- related considerations, technological considerations, social considerations at home, and social considerations in the workplace. There are a number of factors that come into play, including individual and soc ial factors, as well as organisational and work- related influences. 2021, according to Staniscuaski et al. Using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), recent research with a sample size of 150 and a P value of less than.005 has shown that implementing work -life balance approaches in an appropriate manner can have a positive affect on employee performance. An employee who is content will have the ability to accomplish their job with an innate motivation, in contrast to an employee who is unsatisfied and is having difficulty finding a balance between their career, their family, and their own personal well -being(H D & Lakawat, 2021). 7 Work environment and productivity Despite the fact that the physical work environment and individual characteristics such as persona lity have an impact on remote productivity, variables such as having a healthy mental state, having flexible work arrangements, and having the ability to manage oneself may considerably enhance production. The individual\\'s level of job productivity is dire ctly proportional to the setting in which they are working. According to Tejero et al. (2021), the work environment is defined as the location where employees carry out their duties. The personality feature also has an effect on the amount of work that is accomplished. It was shown that both the processing of knowledge and the generation of new knowledge were negatively impacted, but the processing of information at home improved (Shimura et al., 2021). Both having a healthy mental state (Smite et al., 2022 ) and having flexible work arrangements have been demonstrated to have favourable effects on employees who work remotely (Klimova & Klimov, 2021). According to Klimov and Klimov (2021), essential characteristics that may be used to predict employee product ivity include self -management strategies and an acceptable working environment for remote employees. Discussion This research addresses the underexplored impact of remote work on productivity, as past reviews have not systematically evaluated this topic. T he study considers 46 documents, primarily focusing on productivity comparisons and employee well -being across different sectors. Findings suggest that remote work has led to decreased productivity, especially for women, with mothers disproportionately aff ected. Additionally, factors like ineffective human resource policies, overtime at home, and work- related damages negatively impacted productivity. While working remotely does aid in reducing physical stress, it does not necessarily enhance productivity, w ith issues like interwork conflict among married partners and social isolation reducing work efficiency. Most data reviewed pertain to the pandemic period, as pre -pandemic data is sparse, given limited publications on remote work before this period. The la ck of focus on personality traits and age as moderating factors, despite their potential influence, further highlights gaps in existing literature. Conclusion This research underscores the need for improved remote work policies, as current arrangements inadequately support productivity, especially among women. While remote work reduces physical stress, it also bring new challenges, such as increased home responsibilities and social Exploring the Impact of Remote Work on Productivity: A Systematic Review isolation, that diminish productivity. In addition, this research highlights the importance of tailoring remote work policies to accommodate varying personal and professional needs, particularly for women balancing work and household responsibilities. Addressing digital skill gaps, reducing isolation, and fostering supportive virtual work environments may further enhance productivity and well -being among remote employees across sectors and regions. The study calls for further research considering socioeconomic variations, blue -collar versus white - collar work comparisons, and divers e geographical contexts to gain a comprehensive understanding of remote work´s productivity impacts across various demographics and job types.

Recent research in BLS Beyond the Numbers,October 2024, \"The rise in remote work since the pandemic and its impact on productivity\" by Sabrina WulffPabilonia and Jill Janocha Redmond, economists in the Office of Productivity and Technology, finds a positiverelationship between total factor productivity and remote work.New research incorporating the 2023 Total Factor Productivity data for major industries (revised March 21, 2025),Remote Work and Productivity Growth from 2019-23, was presented at the 2025 Society of GovernmentEconomists Annual Conference. A paper is forthcoming. According to the American Community Survey (ACS), remote work increased dramatically across all majorindustries between 2019 and 2021. Then, with the removal of all social distancing restrictions in 2022, thepercentage of remote workers fell slightly. However, it was still higher than its 2019 level in all industries exceptagriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting, which returned to its 2019 level. (See chart 1.) U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICSSearch ProductivityGoOPT HomeOPT PublicationsOPT DataOPT Methods About OPTContact OPT Chart 2 shows the relationship between TFP growth and the percentage-point change in remote workers across 61industries in the private business sector from 2019 to 2021, when remote work was at its peak. The horizontal axismeasures the change in the percentage of remote workers, while the vertical axis measures the annual percentagegrowth of TFP. The size of the bubbles represents the industry’s share of total private business sector output in2019. The fitted line shows the output-weighted average relationship between the two measures: a onepercentage-point increase in the percentage of remote workers is associated with a 0.08 percentage-point increasein TFP growth. This association is 0.09 in the 2019–22 period, and relationships in both periods are statisticallysignificant. To better measure the association of the rise in remote work with productivity, we plot the relationship between theincrease in the percentage of remote workers and the excess in TFP growth in the pandemic period (2019–21) overthe prior-business-cycle TFP growth (2007-19). The vertical axis in Chart 3 represents the percentage pointdifference between the pandemic-period TFP growth and the prior-business-cycle TFP growth (2007–19). Thehorizontal axis represents the percentage-point change in remote workers (2019-21). Using this excess TFP growthmeasure, we still find a positive and statistically significant association between the rise in remote work and TFPgrowth, although the magnitude of the association is slightly smaller (significant at the 10-percent level). A onepercentage-point increase in remote work is associated with a 0.05 percentage-point increase in TFP growth. A 1 percentage-point increase in the percentage of remote workers is associated with a 0.1 percentage-pointsdecrease in growth in unit labor costs. Our findings, shown in charts 4-6, also demonstrate a consistent pattern:the larger the increase in remote work, the larger the decrease in growth in unit capital, energy, material, andservice costs across industries. These relationships, with the exception of energy costs, are statistically significant,reinforcing the reliability of our research. The associations are notably stronger than the link with unit labor costs,with values ranging from -0.2 to -0.4. A 1 percentage-point increase in the percentage of remote workers isassociated with a 0.4 percentage-points decrease in growth in unit office building costs. See chart data in Excel.

The Rise of Remote Work Evidence on Productivity and Preferences from Firm and Worker Surveys∗ Alexander Bartik Zo ¨e Cullen Ed Glaeser Michael Luca Christopher Stanton June 2023 Abstract Drawing on surveys of small business owners and employees, we present three main findings about the evolution of remote work after the onset of COVID-19. First, uptake of remote work was abrupt and widespread in jobs suitable for telework according to the task-based measure from Dingel and Neiman (2020). The initial adoption lead to a persistent shift in work arrangements that both firms and workers forecast would continue into the future. Second, business leaders’ perceptions of how remote work affected productivity shifted over time. In early 2020, 70 percent of small business owners reported a productivity dip due to remote work. By contrast, the median business owner reported a positive productivity impact of remote work by 2021. Third, 21 percent of workers report being willing to accept a pay cut in excess of 10 percent if it allowed them to continue working from home, but the median worker in a teleworkable job would not tradeoff any compensation for the option of continued remote work. Taken together, our evidence points to perceived productivity gains and some workers’ preferences as reasons for the persistence of remote work in the years following the onset of COVID-19. ∗A prior version of this paper circulated under the title “What Jobs Are Being Done at Home During the COVID-19 Crisis?

Remote work advocates pointed to a techno-utopian vision with little time wasted on commuting, and in which people work from anywhere they choose (Toffler 1980). Despite this promise, remote work adoption remained low prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Skeptics pointed to the possibility of lower productivity of remote workers, resulting from challenges such as monitoring and learning, as well as reduced opportunities for chance encounters that could spur innovation (Catalini 2018). The COVID-19 pandemic brought about widespread disruptions and lockdowns, which forced many businesses to either shut down or transition to remote work. In this paper, we report results from nation-wide surveys of U.S. business owners and workers, conducted repeatedly over the span of two years after the onset of COVID-19. We examine three core issues: (1) business owners’ choices to transition to remote work, and remain remote, as a function of industry characteristics (2) the evolving productivity effects of transitioning to remote work, including the sources of gains and challenges from adopting remote work, (3) employees’ valuation of remote work as an amenity, measured by their willingness to trade off salary for working from home. We document that remote work remained persistent during our sample period and we shed light on possible reasons why firms and workers did not immediately revert back to their pre-pandemic modes of in-office operation. We first show that the pandemic-induced growth of remote work was substantial and persistent. Nearly half of small business owners in surveys conducted in March and April of 2020 reported transitioning on-site workers to remote work. Business owners in January and May 2021 surveys reported that remote work remained elevated, with over half indicating 2 that some workers were engaged in remote work at the time of the survey (including workers who were newly hired into remote positions or those who worked remotely prior to the pandemic). This employer-level sampling frame reflects the extent to which businesses were impacted by remote work, but the shift to remote work likely did not include all workers. Worker-level surveys, conducted in 2022, allow us to pinpoint the extent to which remote work permeated the labor force. Approximately a third of workers who were on-site before the pandemic reported working remotely at least one day per week; a quarter worked remotely at least 2 days per week. Variation in remote work adoption and persistence tracks the Dingel and Neiman (2020) measure of telework suitability based on the task content of different occupations. These patterns indicate that many jobs could have been done outside of the office prior to the pandemic, but most firms and workers were not working remotely. The onset of COVID-19 shifted work arrangements, and we explore possible reasons for the persistence of this shift. Second, business owners and senior leaders reported that remote work became more pro- ductive over time. At the beginning of the pandemic, 70 percent of small business owners perceived a productivity dip due to remote work, but this pattern reversed in subsequent sur- veys, with the median owner reporting a positive productivity impact by early 2021. Firms engaged in adjustments that improved productivity, including technological investments, the introduction of training programs, and alteration of job characteristics and task assignments. Surveyed workers point to improvements in managers’ ability to lead remote teams as an im- portant contributor to the positive shift in productivity experienced over time. Nevertheless, after a year of experience with remote work, business owners reported in the 2021 survey wave reported difficultly monitoring remote employees, and they believed remote employees were less able to learn new skills. These challenges appear to be compounded in firms with 3 more people, as owners of larger firms are, on average, less optimistic about the productivity effects of remote work. Finally, the amenity value of remote work varies considerably across individuals. Workers’ willingness to trade off pay for the option to work remotely differs markedly across people: approximately 60% of respondents would not accept lower pay in exchange for remote work as an amenity, despite working in a job that is suitable for telework. While most workers do not value remote work, the shift to working from home is valued by a sizeable share of the labor force. 21% of workers would accept a pay cut of 10% or more to avoid returning to the office. Socio-demographic characteristics explain some variation in the amenity value of remote work. Among those whose jobs can be done remotely, females are 16% more likely than males to be willing to give up at least 10% of their pay to remain remote. Those with a college degree report higher valuations for remote work, while workers 50 or older are the least likely to be willing to pay anything to work remotely. Taken together, our evidence on the arc of productivity and the amenity value of remote work helps to explain why it has persisted even after COVID-19 health concerns subsided for many workers. Our results make three main contributions relative to a voluminous concurrent literature. First, our paper draws from multiple surveys over time, allowing us to trace the evolution of individual perceptions toward remote work. While each survey is primarily cross-sectional, we can track some repeat responses by business owners. Results from a within-business owner analysis of changes in remote work productivity perceptions largely match the positive evolution that we document in repeated cross-sections. Second, we have both firm-level and employee-level surveys – allowing us to understand points of agreement and tension from the employer and employee perspectives. While our measures of the degree of remote work persistence qualitatively align with Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 4 (2021) on why remote work will stick, our evidence on the employer perspective has, to our knowledge, only had limited coverage in the prior literature. Indeed, a popular media narrative in the first 2 years after COVID onset suggested that workers and managers were at odds over remote work (Rosalsky 2022). Our evidence suggests this tension was not universal, as many firms embraced hybrid or fully remote arrangements. While employees tended to be more optimistic about remote work productivity than employers in our surveys, by and large their reports corroborate each others’ experiences. Still, some employers did report lower productivity under remote work, yet our surveys show that few of these employers with negative productivity perceptions enforced return-to-office policies for workers. It is possible that the large number of employers with positive remote work perceptions boosted workers’ outside options in the labor market generally, limiting the ability of any employer – even those with modestly negative views of remote work – to impose a return to the pre-pandemic status quo. Third, we elicit willingness to pay for the opportunity to work remotely and capture some of the first measures of workers’ valuations for remote work as an amenity in the post-pandemic era. 2 Data 2.1 Sample Description and Survey Timeline Our first survey population is owners of small businesses, collected through surveys conducted by Alignable, Inc., https://www.alignable.com, the largest network and community of Small Business Owners in North America. The Alignable surveys were conducted in 4 waves. Each wave went out to a large subset of Alignable’s members, although Alignable did not share the exact number of members solicited. The first survey was conducted in March 5 and April of 2020 (N=1699). Wave 2 occurred eight weeks after the first survey, in May 2020, when Alignable conducted a follow-up survey to probe remote work further (N=915). The first two Alignable surveys occurred while much of the country was under stay-at- home restrictions. Wave 3 of the Alignable survey was conducted in January of 2021, after reopening had occurred in much of the country, but at a time when mobility patterns had not returned to pre-Covid levels for either commuting or personal trips (N=2344). The fourth wave occurred in May of 2021, when vaccines had become available to the majority of the population (N=463). Most waves of the small business owner surveys had similar questions, allowing us to study changes over time, while each wave also had a distinct set of questions that were relevant for forecasts and perceptions at the time of the survey. For our main analysis, we pool survey waves in 2020 between March and May, totalling 2,545 completed responses, and pool survey waves in 2021 between January and May, to- talling 2,789 responses.1Table 1 describes the total number of unique survey respondents, and the number who completed each question in square brackets. The small business owner surveys comes from a convenience sample, making benchmarks to other sources important for understanding the representativeness of estimates from these samples. Figure 1 Panel A shows that the pooled survey sample roughly matches the firm size distribution of small businesses in the 2017 U.S. Census of businesses. The Alignable firms are, however, slightly larger than those in the Census for a mechanical reason: the remote work questions were only deployed to business owners who reported having at least 2 total employees (including themselves), whereas the Census includes firms with only a single person working. Panel B of Figure 1 shows that the survey data roughly matches the distribution of 1Each survey wave is largely cross-sectional. When computing summary statistics for repeat respondents, we take the first non-missing observation for each distinct survey question. 6 teleworkability at the industry-level in the Census data. These industry-level measures of teleworkability come from Dingel and Neiman (2020), who construct an occupation-level classification of remote work feasibility (i.e. an assessment of which jobs could plausibly be done at home) that they aggregate to the industry level. We note that post-vaccine surveys somewhat over-represent firms in industries with relatively high teleworkable employment compared to the pre-pandemic Census data. It is possible that these firms were most resilient through the pandemic, contributing to their over-representation. Overall, these exercises suggest that the convenience samples are roughly representative of the universe of small businesses. Prior work with a similar sampling design yielded accurate forecasts of demand for Paycheck Protection Program loans (Bartik et al. 2020), suggesting that aggregating across the participants in these surveys yields reliable inference.2 We also conducted two survey waves of workers through the Lucid platform. Lucid is a quota based internet sampling company that produces representative survey samples based on population demographics. We utilized a sampling scheme to target respondents who were employed at the time of the survey with demographics that match the Census distribution of age, gender, and income. Wave 1 of the worker survey was conducted in November and December 2021 and had 1810 respondents while Wave 2 of the worker survey was conducted in June 2022 and had 974 respondents. We have found that the Lucid sample is skewed toward occupations that are more likely to be digital or teleworkable, so we have re-weighted the Lucid responses to match the distribution of Standard Occupational Classification System (SOC) codes in the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2Other papers using surveys over this time period have documented the power of convenience samples to approximate the distribution of firm characteristics in administrative samples across different contexts (Humphries, Neilson, and Ulyssea 2020; Guerrero-Amezaga et al. 2022). 7 3 Results Table 1 reports summary statistics from firm survey waves pooled from the first half of 2020 (Column 1) and the first half of 2021 (Column 2), and the difference between those means (Column 3). The difference in these pooled waves roughly corresponds to the pre- and post- vaccine era. Employee survey waves from 2021 and 2022 are presented in Columns 4 and 5, and their difference in Column 6. The first row of results captures employment relative to January 2020, before the pan- demic had become widespread. In both the pre and post-vaccine surveys, sample firms had between 10 and 11 employees on average. In the early survey waves, firms reported that headcount had fallen on average by about 23 percent between January and April 2020. Na- tionally, nonfarm private employment fell 16% over the same January to April 2020 period, according to BLS payroll surveys. 3.1 The Level and Persistence of Remote Work In the first half of 2020, 47% of firms had transitioned at least some workers who had previously been working on-site to remote work.3The reported share of firms with workers who transitioned to remote work was 40% for the employers in our post-vaccine survey waves in the first half of 2021.4In the post-vaccine surveys, 54% of employers reported having at 3The pre-vaccine remote work measures are binary indicators based on the question “Relative to January 2020, have any of your employees transitioned to working remotely or working from home?”. 4The post-vaccine remote work measures come from the question “Over the last year, did any of your employees work remotely (regularly working at home 2+ days/week)? Select all that apply.” The answer choices were: a) “No”, b) “Yes, and they were already remote pre-pandemic”, c) “Yes, existing employees transitioned to remote work and they remain remote today”, d) “Yes, existing employees transitioned to remote work but they have returned to the office or left the firm”, e) “Yes, new employees were hired into permanently remote positions”, f) “Yes, new employees were hired into temporarily remote positions.” We code employees who transition based on choices c), d), and e). If we include option f), our measure increases from 40% to 41.5%. 8 least some employees who were remote, which includes firms with remote employees before Covid and new employees who joined the firm as remote workers. The worker surveys corroborate the extreme movement to remote work and its persistence. In 2021, 32% of workers reported having transitioned from on-site to remote work, and this share remains virtually unchanged in 2022. By the summer of 2022, 35% of respondents worked remotely at least 1 day per week after we re-weight the sample to match the distribution of the workforce, while over 40% of the raw responses (without re-weighting) indicate some working from home at the time of the survey.5These results are roughly consistent with the updated data series reported in Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2021), whose own surveys indicate that a bit over 40% of workers were remote during the early summer of 2022. We further validate our measures of remote work prevalence by comparing them with the potential for remote work measure from Dingel and Neiman (2020) at the industry level. The Dingel and Neiman (2020) classification has been influential for understanding the potential for remote work across industries and countries (Saltiel 2020; Gottlieb et al. 2021), and the ability for firms to transition to remote work reduced the likelihood of financial distress during the pandemic (Papanikolaou and Schmidt 2022). Aggregating the Dingel and Neiman measure up to the industry-level, the average small business in the Alignable sample had 27 to 31 percent of their workforce in a teleworkable occupation. In the first wave of our Alignable survey, there is a 30 percent correlation across industries between the potential for remote work identified by Dingel and Neiman (2020) and the actual prevalence of remote work in the survey. The correlation is 28 percent in the post-vaccine survey. These correlations are presented graphically in Figure 2 Panel A. Panel B presents a comparison 5Tabulations for remote work prevalence in the worker surveys come from the questions “Have you worked from home (remotely) for your main job at any point since March 2020?”, “Did you primarily work from home prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020?” and “Last week, how many days did you work from home for your main job?”. 9 with Current Population Survey (CPS) data from a nationally representative sample that asks respondents whether they worked remotely due to COVID in the last 4 weeks.6The wording of the question will mean that workers who were remote prior to the pandemic will not be included in this measure along with those who remain remote for non-health related reasons. For these reasons, our measures of remote work exceed those in the CPS, but the correlation is strong, at 0.32 and 0.29 in the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine surveys, respectively. Respondents in both employer and worker surveys predicted that remote work would persist long-term. Returning to Table 1, the row labeled “Share Remote Work 2+ Days in Future,” displays employers’ predictions for the average share of their workforce that will “continue to work remotely (at least 2 normal working days per week) once the COVID- 19 crisis ends and other businesses and services reopen.” In the post-vaccine firm survey, employers with remote workers indicate that 52% of their workforce would continue to remain remote at least 2 day per week. For workers, approximately 26% of June 2022 survey respondents indicated they would remain remote at least 2 days/week at this time next year “assuming no pandemic interruptions,” while 13% (unreported in the Table) indicated they would be fully remote and a further 9% indicated they would work remotely 1 day per week.7 Given these answers, at the time of our surveys, the modal worker with any days working from home expected that a hybrid schedule, working remotely between 2-4 days per week, would be most likely going forward. 6Education explains a substantial share of the variation in the Dingel and Neiman (2020) measure and the CPS rate of remote work. See Mongey, Pilossoph, and Weinberg (2021); Bick et al. (2020); Forsythe et al. (2020) for implications for inequality. 7Employer responses in the Survey of Business Uncertainty predicted a long-term increase in remote work early in the pandemic, consistent with our results (Altig et al. 2020). This shift in expectations remained elevated over time. 10 3.2 Remote Work Productivity To capture firm perceptions about the productivity consequences of remote work, we asked business owners in the Alignable survey to quantify productivity relative to pre-COVID non-remote levels. In most survey waves, we asked about individual productivity with the question “Compared to January 2020, how has remote work affected productivity for the employees who transitioned to working from home?” Respondents were asked to move a slider between -100 and 100, with labels “Much Less Productive” at -80, “About the Same” at 0, and “Much More Productive” at +80. In the third survey wave we also used a between- subjects design to assess the company-wide, rather than individual-level, implications of remote work. Instead of the default question about individual-level productivity, half of the respondents saw a question phrased as “Compared to January 2020, how did your business’s overall productivity change as a result of remote work?” The mean and standard deviation of responses when the framing is about individual worker versus company productivity are nearly identical, so we pool the results from these two separate questions.8 To assess workers’ perceptions of the productivity of remote work, we asked the following analogous questions “Thinking about your most recent work from home experience, how does the productivity of remote work for you and your coworkers compare to in-office pro- ductivity?” Participants saw the same sliders from -100 to 100. To assess changes over the pandemic, we asked “Reflecting on the last 20 months, has remote work become harder or easier overall compared to when you first started working remotely?”. Respondents chose from 5 answers: ”Much harder”, which we code as -2, ”Harder”, which we code as -1, ”About the same”, which we code as 0, ”Easier”, which we code as 1, and ”Much easier”, which we 8As we discuss later in Figure 4, the productivity assessments framed at the firm and work level also vary over the firm size distribution as a function of whether we use the worker or the firm-level framing. 11 code as 2. While the shift to remote work was accompanied by productivity declines in the early stages of the pandemic, merely one year later, not only did firms and employees report regaining productivity relative to January 2020, but the median respondent reported that productivity surpassed what it had been before the pandemic. Rows 6-8 of Table 1 describe the dramatic shift in productivity experienced between 2020 and 2021. “Productivity of Remote Workers” (row 6) summarizes reported productivity of remote workers from the firm perspective (Columns 1-2) and the employee perspective (Columns 4-5). In the first half of 2020, firms with workers switching to remote work reported lower average productivity for remote work than in-person work, with a mean answer of -16.30, which is statistically different from 0.9By the first half of 2021, firms reported that the productivity of remote work was higher than in-person work, with an average response of 16.76, a statistically significant increase of 33 points on a -100 to 100 scale relative to the prior year. Employee self-reports align with employer responses. Employees who transitioned to working remotely in 2021 perceived a boost in productivity when comparing remote work with in-person work (mean=19.13), and this persists into 2022 (mean=21.08). When we aggregate responses simply by whether the respondent perceived remote work to be more or less productive than in-person work (see “Share with Productivity >0”, row 7), we find the shift in perceived productivity is not driven by a subset of extreme responses but rather a shift at the median. In 2020, seventy percent of employers reported that remote 9The only other firm-level survey of remote work productivity from early in the pandemic that we are aware of comes from Ozimek (2020). He asked 500 hiring managers in April of 2020 how work from home progressed relative to expectations, with 56% reporting it going better than expected. He also probes reasons why productivity has changed – with the main factors being technological challenges and workers becoming distracted while at home. International surveys of employers from later in the pandemic include Criscuolo et al. (2021) and Erdsiek (2021), both of which conclude that many employers had positive perceptions of remote work productivity as the pandemic progressed. These surveys also suggest that firms that invested in practice changes to facilitate remote work are more optimistic about the long-term use of remote work. 12 work reduced productivity relative to in-person work, but by 2021 less than half of employers viewed remote work as less productive. Finally, when asked directly to assess how the productivity of remote work has changed, comparing the present with remote work during the first month of pandemic disruptions, again on a scale of -100 to 100, respondents in 2021 reported a 10.54 point increase in productivity, which is statistically different from 0. When we compare the same respondents across multiple survey waves (N=65), the average within-person change is 10.98 points, closely matching the retrospective perception of changes from the full sample. Figure 3 Panel A shows the entire distribution of employers’ perceived relative produc- tivity of remote to in-person work. We observe the rightward shift of the entire distribution from predominantly negative to predominantly positive between 2020 and 2021. Panel B displays a histogram of employee perceived relative productivity of remote work, corroborat- ing the alignment between employer and employee perception in 2021. The 2022 employee survey also indicates that the boost in the perceived relative productivity of remote work compared to in-person work remains remarkably persistent. Taken together, we find robust evidence of an upward shift in the perceived productivity of remote work. By 2021, the per- ceived productivity of remote work overtook the perceived productivity of in-person work for both business owners and employees. 3.3 Sources of Remote Work Productivity Changes We have examined firm, industry, and worker-level factors that correlate with the relative level of remote work productivity or its change over the pandemic. Conditional on engaging in remote work, neither the industry nor occupational suitability for telework, education, or gender correlate with our productivity measures. Thus, measures of theoretical suitability 13 for remote work appear to matter most for the extensive margin, rather than for variation in assessments on the intensive margin. However, firm size prior to the pandemic is robustly negatively correlated with the relative productivity of remote work (see Appendix Table A1). Size is the only pre-pandemic firm characteristic that has a meaningful correlation with productivity assessments. Owners of larger firms reported lower levels of productivity at the early stages of the pandemic, and the negative relationship between firm size and productivity remained through our post-vaccine surveys. Looking at the raw data, Figure 4 suggests that firms with between 30-60 workers in January of 2020 had the lowest assessed productivity effects of remote work in January of 2021, whereas the relationship appears to recover a bit for firms above 100 employees. Our data contain very few larger firms, as our sampling frame for firm-level responses was based on small businesses, so we cannot detect whether this uptick would extend to much larger firms. We now turn to providing evidence on additional sources of changes in remote work productivity over time, as the surveys were designed to uncover several inputs that may correlate with perceptions of longer-term remote work productivity impacts, including on hiring, learning about new tasks or skills, and worker management. We asked respondents in the May 2021 survey wave about the main positive and negative factors contributing to their experience with remote work using the questions “Are there any factors that have helped to improve remote worker productivity over the past year? (Select all that apply)” and “Are there any factors that have reduced remote worker productivity over the past year? (Select all that apply).” On the positive side, respondents could select: “Coordination be- came easier as more people worked remotely”, “Employees learned to work remotely more effectively or we conducted training”, “We changed processes or routines”, “We started us- 14 ing new technologies”, and “We hired employees who are better suited for remote work”. In addition to these options, respondents could select ”Not applicable: Nothing has been posi- tive” (chosen by 35%) or could enter free text. Options on the negative side included: “Team relationships deteriorated/communication difficulties”, “Difficulty onboarding or hiring new people”, “Team burn-out, exhaustion, and/or health problems”, “Monitoring employees be- came harder”, and “Team members leaving the firm”. Table 2 displays the share choosing each option (as the mean of the dependent variable), along with regression coefficients relating the responses to industry-level teleworkability and firm size prior to the pandemic. The main sources of positive contributors are: new technol- ogy (chosen by 32%), process or routine changes (29%), and learning/training (24%). All three are positively correlated with industry-teleworkability, while only learning/training is positively correlated with the pre-pandemic firm size. Improved coordination was chosen by under 15% of responses and hiring more suitable workers was chosen by under 2%. The three most important negative factors are communication difficulties or relationship deterioration (25%), monitoring challenges (24%), and burnout (22%). Onboarding chal- lenges and attrition were chosen by 12 and 9 percent of respondents, respectively. Responses highlight these main challenges arose after a year of remote work. Industries most prone to going fully remote (high teleworkability), while appearing to reap several advantages of go- ing remote, also faced communications and monitoring difficulties. Larger firms also suffered greater communications loss. Firm size also appears to correlate with onboarding challenges. Taken together, it appears that larger firms and those with more teleworkable employees were more effective at training workers for remote work, while process changes and new tech- nology help to explain the positive productivity effects documented later in the pandemic. However, larger firms suffered communications losses, which may explain why the leaders of 15 many large public companies have pushed aggressively for return to office policies. These patterns help to explain the positive productivity effects of remote work in individual jobs (Bloom et al. 2015) and the low rates of pre-pandemic remote work for those in occupations involving team work (Mas and Pallais 2020). While our prior approach asked business owners to choose the most relevant factors for positive and negative productivity changes, we asked all owners three questions to gauge their qualitative impressions on hiring, employee learning, and monitoring even if they didn’t select these dimensions. We used the following questions: “Reflect on the employees you have hired directly into remote positions. On average, how do these hires compare to the employees you would have been able to hire if the position were not remote?”, “Compared to in-person work, would you say that remote employees are faster, slower, or about the same in how quickly they learn on the job (how to do their tasks, how to do new things, etc.)?”, and “How does your ability to spot employees’ strengths and weaknesses when they are remote compare to when they are in person?”. Table 3 Panel A presents the data, which we summarize here. Fewer than 10 percent of respondents reported that the new hires for remote positions are of lower quality, while 45 percent indicated candidate quality improved relative to hires for non-remote positions. Meanwhile, 39 percent of employers perceived that remote workers are slower to pick up new tasks or learn new skills on-the-job (Column 3), consistent with the notion that observabil- ity or face-to-face interactions may facilitate knowledge transmission (Sandvik et al. 2020; Battiston, Blanes i Vidal, and Kirchmaier 2021). 61 percent perceived that monitoring was significantly more difficult under remote work (Column 4). We also probed workers with detailed questions related to perceptions of the drivers of productivity changes. These include: “Relative to working in person, how easy is it for you 16 and your coworkers to get up to speed on new projects or tasks when working remotely?”, “Relative to working in person, how easy is it for you and your coworkers to learn new skills at work when working remotely?”, “Relative to working in person, how easy is it for your boss to understand your work and contribution when working remotely?”, and “Over the last 20 months, has your boss become better or worse at managing remote teams? If you do not have a boss, please select Not applicable”. In Table 3 Panel B, workers are split roughly equally between perceiving that remote increased, decreased or left unchanged their ability to get up to speed or pick up new skills. However, 43 percent believe their manager became better at managing work after the tran- sition to remote work. This is a somewhat surprising result given managers’ own accounts to journalists indicate increased difficulties with their jobs (Savage 2022). It is possible that workers feel liberated from monitoring or excessive supervision, the dimensions where man- agers report difficulty in remote environments. This leads to our next question about how workers value some of these aspects of remote work as an amenity. 3.4 Valuations of Remote Work as an Amenity Remote work affects not only productivity, but also the experience of work. Ultimately the longevity of remote work, and associated compensation, will reflect both the perceived productivity of working remotely as well as employee preference for remote work (Barrero et al. 2022). There are many reasons that remote work might be considered an amenity. For example commute times and costs may decline, home-offices may be more relaxing, and home-kitchens may produce better meals than options at the workplace. On the other hand, finding space at home to work may be burdensome and expensive (Stanton and Tiwari 2021), 17 and employees may miss spending time with colleagues. We examine which types of employees view remote work as an amenity, versus a dis- amenity, by examining how workers would respond to wage adjustments to maintain remote- work arrangements. We asked two questions of workers: first, “Suppose your employer told you that returning to the office 5 days/week was mandatory to keep your current pay, but you could work remotely if you took a pay cut. Would you work in the office or would you take a pay cut to work remotely?” Those who answer that they would not take a paycut to work remotely in the first question are coded as being willing to pay at most 0% of their salary to work remotely; for the rest, we asked what size pay cut they would be willing to accept. Specifically, the question was worded: “we are interested in understanding how much value you place on working remotely, and how much of a pay cut – if any – you would be willing to take in order to maintain the ability to work remotely on an ongoing basis. With that in mind, what’s the largest cut you would take in order to continue working from home (rather working from the office 5 days/week or quitting to find a new job)? For example, if you would be willing to take a 20% pay cut if it allowed you to work remotely at your current job, select 20%.” These questions allow us to estimate the strength of worker preferences for remote work through their willingness to pay for the opportunity to work remotely compared to on-site. In Figure 5 we describe which types of workers, among those in teleworkable occupations, were willing to accept a pay cut to work remotely at the time of the surveys. The figure also provides detail on the largest pay cut respondents would accept. About 40% would have been willing to take a pay cut greater than or equal to 5% (see the orange crosses for ≥5% of Salary), meaning that 60% were unwilling to take a small pay cut to remain remote.1021% 105% was the smallest category available to respondents. 18 of respondents were willing to pay at least 10% of their salary to remain remote.11About 9% of respondents were willing to give up 20% of salary or more. These results indicate that the modal worker has a limited valuation for remote work amenities, but there is a subset of the labor force that highly values remote work. The remaining rows of Figure 5 explore whether this heterogeneity varies systematically with worker characteristics. Workers with a college degree are more likely, at 44% compared to 34%, to be willing to pay a non-zero amount for remote work. They are also 24 percent more likely to be willing to pay in excess of 10% or 20% of salary than those without a degree. Patterns by age, shown in the next 3 rows, indicate that older workers were less likely than young workers to be willing to pay for remote work. Around 14% of workers over 50 were willing to give up more than 10% of their compensation to remain remote, whereas 24% of those younger than 50 were willing to do so. The distribution of willingness to pay for females versus males has interesting patterns. 37% of females have a positive willingness to pay for remote work compared to 42% of males, but females who do value remote work would be willing to pay more to keep the option. Overall, they are 16 percent more likely than males to be willing to pay at least 10% of salary and over 60 percent more likely to be willing to pay at least 20% of salary to remain remote. We originally expected that these differences would arise because of childcare responsibilities, but instead we detect few differences based on whether the respondent is the primary caregiver for a child. The next few rows examine how willingness to pay varies across industries and as- sessments of productivity. Not surprisingly, those in construction, manufacturing, and 11Our evidence shows valuations for remote work seem remarkably stable. For example, Mas and Pallais (2017) find that about 25% of workers would be willing to give up approximately 14% of their pay for a remote work option. 19 oil and gas extraction have the lowest willingness to pay. Those in professional services, health/education, and other industries have higher shares of willingness to pay. It is possible that some of these industry differences arise from productivity factors, as workers in the bottom tercile of self-reported productivity with remote work have the lowest willingness to pay. Finally, revealed preferences for remote work seem to align with stated willingness to pay. Those who teleworked pre-pandemic have much higher willingness to pay and those who switched jobs during the pandemic, which for many would have represented a move to a remote occupation, have a higher willingness to pay to remain remote rather than joining their colleagues in office. It is possible that expansion of those willing to switch jobs for remote positions will alleviate some of the adverse selection concerns documented with remote work pre-pandemic (Emanuel and Harrington 2021). 4 Conclusion The COVID pandemic led to dramatic economic disruptions, as health concerns created by the virus led people to stay home and businesses to suspend in-person activities (Alfaro et al. 2020; B´ eland, Brodeur, and Wright). While the shift to remote work was sizeable and allowed those in teleworkable occupations to avoid unemployment (Brynjolfsson et al. 2020; Forsythe et al. 2020; Bick et al. 2020), many business leaders intended to reopen in-person operations as soon as possible (Balla-Elliott et al. 2022). This sentiment seemingly reflected the early experiences with remote work, which we document in this paper were largely associated with productivity declines. However, emerging research, documented here and elsewhere, suggests that remote work 20 will be much more prevalent in the future (Bick et al. 2020; Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2021). Our evidence suggests that it is the combination of firms’ improved productivity after gaining experience with remote work, plus some workers’ high willingness to pay for telework as an amenity, that contributes to the long-term increase in remote work that the pandemic generated. Firms point to organizational learning, investment in IT, and process changes as core to understanding why remote work productivity increased over time. As organizations potentially become more geographically dispersed in the future, we see the documentation of these factors as especially important for managers who will need to navigate leading remote teams.

Mapping from survey questions to variables is described in the text. We group together the two firm surveys conducted prior to COVID-19 vaccinations becoming available (Column 1) and the two surveys conducted after COVID- 19 vaccinations became available (Column 2). Each rows summarizes survey responses along with means, standard deviations (in parentheses) for non-binary variables, and the number of observations for the response [in brackets]. Columns 3 and 6 display the difference between the prior columns in the firm and worker surveys, respectively, with standard errors for the estimates of the difference (in parentheses). Remote productivity measures are only populated for firms or workers transitioning to remote work after March 2020. In firm survey wave 2, the question about remote persistence is only asked to firms having remote workers. Means in the worker surveys are re-weighted to match the occupation distribution in OES data. In practice, this puts additional weight on observations from respondents in non-teleworkable occupations (Dingel and Neiman 2020) and is why the sample size on the remote work productivity question is larger than the mean rate of remote work multiplied by the original sample size. 31 Table 2: Positive and Negative Factors Contributing to Remote Work Productivity Panel A : Positive Contributors to Productivity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Coordination Learning Process Changes New Tech New Hires Industry Teleworkability (D & N) 0.284*** 0.331*** 0.308*** 0.308*** 0.0376 (0.0945) (0.109) (0.117) (0.117) (0.0324) Log Firm Employment Pre-Covid+1 0.00801 0.0841*** 0.0195 0.0402 -0.00583 (0.0245) (0.0280) (0.0321) (0.0311) (0.00573) Mean of DV .144 .235 .292 .318 .011 N 277 277 277 277 277 R2.0421 .0609 .0298 .0387 .0134 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Panel B : Negative Contributors to Productivity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Communications Onboarding Burnout Monitoring Attrition Industry Teleworkability (D & N) 0.301*** 0.0946 0.169 0.293*** 0.140** (0.113) (0.0801) (0.106) (0.111) (0.0710) Log Firm Employment Pre-Covid+1 0.0716** 0.0553** 0.0116 0.0366 0.0120 (0.0283) (0.0235) (0.0278) (0.0265) (0.0215) Mean of DV .247 .12 .218 .244 .091 N 275 275 275 275 275 R2.0457 .0286 .0115 .0315 .0309 Note: This table reports regressions of dummy variables from the May 2021 wave of firm surveys. De- pendent variables in Panel A are indicators for responses to the question “Are there any factors that have helped to improve remote worker productivity over the past year? (Select all that apply).” The depen- dent variables across the 5 columns come from these choices: “Coordination became easier as more people worked remotely”, “Employees learned to work remotely more effectively or we conducted training”, “We changed processes or routines”, “We started using new technologies”, and “We hired employees who are better suited for remote work”. In addition to these options, respondents could enter free text. 98 respon- dents (35%) also chose “Nothing has been positive”. Dependent variables in Panel B are responses to the question “Are there any factors that have reduced remote worker productivity over the past year? (Select all that apply).” The dependent variables across the 5 columns come from these choices: “Team relationships deteriorated/communication difficulties”, “Difficulty onboarding or hiring new people”, “Team burn-out, exhaustion, and/or health problems”, “Monitoring employees became harder”, and “Team members leaving the firm”. Industry is missing for some respondents, so regressions include an unreported dummy variable for missing industry-level teleworkability.

Assunta, 00193 Rome, Italy *Correspondence: m.pansini@lumsa.it Abstract: Remote working refers to a working model in which employees can pursue work tasks outside the organization due to the use of technology. Several research papers showed that different assumptions are linked to remote work because of the ﬂexibility and autonomy granted to employees when working remotely or from home. This review consistently aims to describe remote work’s role in employees’ well-being and performance. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 20 peer-reviewed papers published from 2010 until 2021 were selected for this review. Findings showed various and mixed consequences on employees’ performance and well-being. Speciﬁcally, remote working affects employees’ perceptions about themselves and their workplaces and contributes to their physical and mental health, particularly regarding work-life balance. Managerial implications for remote working implementation will be discussed in the paper.

Introduction According to Eurofound 2020 [ 1] estimates, approximately 40% of employees in the EU began to telework full-time due to the pandemic. In the EU, teleworkers were approximately 5% of all employees in 2000 [ 2], and before the outbreak, just 15% of the employed in the EU had ever worked from home [3]. While remote work (or work from home) was not introduced because of the pandemic, the healthcare emergency pushed enormously towards this shift. Therefore, adopting new forms of work organization based on ﬂexibility and autonomy of the employees in terms of the places and times of work was a strategic need for organizations facing COVID-19 [4]. There is no universally accepted deﬁnition of telework [ 5]. Instead, according to the studies published in the last two years, different names covering different patterns of new ways of working emerged. In most cases, the same term is used for several types of work, leading to overlaps. Apart from telework, other terms referring to workers partly or entirely performing their tasks and duties outside of the ofﬁce are: work from home [ 6–8], remote working [ 9–13], telecommuting [ 14–16], or e-working [ 17]. These constitute the most recurrent terminology covering different patterns of work organization outside the workplace. Despite the lexical issue, all these terms are built around two main concepts: (1) being physically outside the organization’s premises while working, and (2) being able to pursue the tasks due to technology. In this work, we will use the abovementioned terms interchangeably. Apart from the deﬁnition issue, the amount of weekly work schedule arranged as remote working depends on each organization and, eventually, the choice can be left to employees [ 18]. Such solutions have proven to decrease ofﬁce costs (e.g., related to heating, ofﬁce size, and premises) [ 19] and be linked to sustainability outcomes (e.g., lower trafﬁc congestion and pollution) [20]. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 12373. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912373 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 12373 2 of 12 Several assumptions are linked to remote work because of the ﬂexibility and autonomy granted to employees when working from home. First, it is assumed that remote work may lower employees’ stress and burnout, and reduce work fatigue and work-home conﬂict, thus enhancing employees’ work engagement and job satisfaction which, in turn, increases job performance [21]. On the other hand, there are other assumptions about the potential drawbacks of remote work at both individual and organizational levels. For example, employees working from home might face problems linked to poor ergonomic facilities, leading to muscular pain or even work accidents, or they might work longer than in the ofﬁce due to the lack of a speciﬁc time frame for the end of work [ 22]. More than that, work isolation may jeopardize employees’ sense of belonging to their organization [ 23] and compromise receiving social support from colleagues, increasing the risk of stress and anxiety [22]. Overall, current research deﬁning what remote working is and its theoretical im- plications provide mixed results regarding the potential effects of this arrangement on organizational processes and employees’ well-being and productivity. At the same time, the last two years required organizations to massively use ICT-based solutions, which implied workplace-relevant changes in HR practices and organizational models, due to the higher ﬂexibility required [ 24]. Signiﬁcant challenges are posed by the need to set up new ways to monitor and assess performance and recognize individual and team results. Remote work cannot allow the direct monitoring and assessment of the work done during the time spent in the ofﬁce [ 4]. At the same time, the unprecedented times in which this shift occurred did not allow organizations to clearly structure such processes [ 24]. Similarly, it is likely that the effects of telework on employees follow the same mixed patterns, with some employees feeling higher well-being in a ﬂexible work environment [21], and others suffering from the reduced attendance in the ofﬁce [23]. Remote work is due to stay after the emergence of the pandemic, and organizational changes are far from being concluded [ 25]. However, the speed and the rate of the shift toward partial or total remote work depends on several factors. These include the techno- logical readiness of the organizations, the quality of services and technological tools put at the employees’ disposal, the employees’ skills and competencies in dealing with these new ways of working, and the feasibility of dislocating tasks and duties outside the ofﬁce. Undoubtedly, time, working conditions and organizational processes are linked to substantial differences in teleworkers’ performance and well-being. At the same time, it is essential to deepen the knowledge about which evidence is rising from the research about the risks and opportunities linked to teleworking and which conditions and settings shape the teleworkers’ satisfaction, well-being, safety, and performance [18]. To sum up, the spread of papers describing the role of teleworking on employees generated a massive amount of knowledge, that is potentially helpful for managers and researchers to individuate good practices to make this new work arrangement sustainable for individuals and organizations. At the same time, ﬁndings on the effects and the applicability of remote working are still mixed. For these reasons, this paper aims to provide a systematic literature review of the risks and opportunities for employees’ stress and well-being when teleworking, as they emerged in papers published from 2010 to 2021. 2.

Results The details reported in Table 1 conﬁrm the high variability in terms of types of or- ganizations, participants’ characteristics, and remote working deﬁnitions reported in the current literature. Nevertheless, it is still possible to individuate some patterns of inﬂuence on employees’ health and well-being. 3.1. Remote Working Inﬂuences the Perceptions of Oneself at Work and of the Workplace Several studies showed that teleworkers experienced higher job satisfaction [ 32,34], work engagement, and motivation [ 45,46]. Such effects are direct or mediated by dynamics related to personal life (i.e., lower work-life conflict because of the higher time spent at home; [ 26]) or to organizational life (i.e., high support from colleagues during teleworking improves beliefs about one’s work conditions; [ 32,39] Other outcomes mentionable in this category regard organizational commitment [ 34], enthusiasm [ 34], and sense of comfort [ 45]: the higher the frequency of teleworking, the higher the likelihood for workers to experience such conditions. Some studies reported positive effects of teleworking on perceived performance [ 40,45,46]. Since well-being and productivity are also connected, teleworking thus increases job and life satisfaction. Life satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between telework and productivity, so the higher the life satisfaction, the higher the productivity [ 47]. Among the selected studies, only Suh and colleagues [ 37] reported a negative effect, showing that the higher the intensity of telework, the higher the strain, and the lower the job satisfaction. Overall, being a teleworker is generally associated with positive outcomes related to the beliefs and emotions about oneself and one’s life. This is particularly true when teleworking reduces the strain from balancing personal and professional life and when the organization supports this arrangement formally and informally . Compared to the effects on individual beliefs, ﬁndings regarding employees’ percep- tions of the workplace are more heterogeneous. In some studies, remote workers show a more sustainable idea of work demands (e.g., lower perceived time pressure; [ 54]), a higher quality of work relationships, and opportunities for professional development [ 45]. In a study, employees listed aspects of work usually referred to as positive (i.e., autonomy, individual decision making, productivity) as constitutional dimensions of e-working [ 28]. At the same time, telework was shown to create adverse effects on beliefs about work behaviors and roles, organization, and relationships. Telework was associated with higher job demands [ 34,37] and role ambiguity [ 37]; lower identiﬁcation with the organization be- cause of the use of ICT tools to communicate [ 23]; reduced effectiveness of communication among colleagues [26] and a higher conﬂict within the organization [55]. 3.2. Teleworking Inﬂuences Employee Health Conditions and Work-Life Balance Several studies showed the preventive role of teleworking for employees’ health, reporting that being a remote worker decreases employee’s levels of stress [ 26,44,46], negative emotions [31], strain [32], depression [22], and alcohol abuse [22]. A protective role of teleworking emerged as well. Remote workers show higher posi- tive affective well-being and higher happiness than their colleagues [ 31,47], above all when they are highly resilient [56]. Interestingly, Grant and colleagues [28] showed that it is not the mere teleworking arrangement, but the ability to manage the boundaries between work life and private life when teleworking that heightens the levels of perceived well-being. Work-life balance is one of the main issues related to remote working. Current research on the role of teleworking on work-life balance showed mixed results. For example, studies focusing on positive outcomes showed a lower work-to-home conﬂict during teleworking days [ 46], even thanks to the lower time pressure due to the remote arrangement [ 26,54]. On the other hand, studies focusing on adverse outcomes showed an inverse relation- Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 12373 8 of 12 ship between remote working conditions and work-life balance, reporting higher conﬂict between the two [30,35,47], which was even conﬁrmed in longitudinal studies (e.g., [34]). At the same time, some studies highlighted risks for mental health occurring during teleworking, showing a direct link with stress, fatigue, and burnout symptoms (e.g., [ 48,55]). Furthermore, when support from colleagues is lacking, this connection is even stronger [ 39]. Within this category, Fonner and colleagues [ 23] described a speciﬁc type of stress occurring from interruptions during the working time due to ICT use. Studies about physical health are heterogeneous as well. Gim énez-Nadal and col- leagues [ 44] show that being a teleworker is a protective factor for perceived physical health, as it decreases levels of pain and fatigue. However, Heiden and colleagues [ 55] demonstrated that an increase in the amount of time in telework is linked to higher levels of fatigue. 4. Discussion The findings show that remote working conditions influence employees’ quality of work and the pleasantness of the work experience in several ways. More specifically, teleworking shapes employees’ perceptions about themselves and their workplace and contributes to their physical and mental health, particularly with regards to work-life balance. A transversal theme that emerges from the ﬁndings is the impact of the frequency or intensity of telework during a regular work week. Although it could be hypothesized that the higher the amount of teleworking during the week, the stronger the effects on personal and work life (positive or negative), the selected papers suggest a more complex picture. Some papers underlined the positive effects of part-time teleworking, showing that employees may beneﬁt from ofﬁce-based and remote working, thus improving their professional skills and strengthening their relational bonds at work [ 45]. At the same time, Suh [ 37] reported differential risks according to the intensity of teleworking. According to the authors, low-intensity teleworkers tend to experience higher work overload, while high-intensity teleworkers tend to experience higher role ambiguity than colleagues. Furthermore, the authors showed that low-intensity teleworkers might experience more severe difﬁculties and perceive their job more negatively than high-intensity telework colleagues. A possible reason for this difference, in contrast with works from Davidescu, is that part-time teleworkers may suffer from the demands occurring from both on-site work and telework. As reported, the intensity of teleworking impacts transversally all the dimensions that emerged in the results. This heterogeneous tendency mirrors the general ﬁndings, that turn out to be mixed and varied. Such variability may be due to the speciﬁc organizational contexts in which teleworking occurs and to the individual differences of the employees involved. However, few studies addressed the role of such dimensions when studying the effects of remote work arrangements. Among these, Grant [ 28] showed that it is not the mere remote work arrangement but the ability to manage the boundaries between work-life and private life when teleworking that heightens the perceived well-being levels. Similarly, Bentley [ 32] reported that the organizational support provided to teleworkers reduces the strain per- ceived by employees more signiﬁcantly than the telework itself. These few studies show that teleworking may generate different outcomes according to the strategic choices made within the organization when planning its introduction. Such choices will depend, for example, on the type of organization implementing the new arrangements. Organizations will likely differ in the amount of autonomy and re- sources they can invest in promoting a strategic implementation of teleworking, depending on whether they are public or private, proﬁt or non-proﬁt, small, medium, or big. These dimensions will impact even middle managers’ roles and inﬂuence employees [ 57]. The same considerations can be made on the organizational sector. Studies published before the pandemic suggest that the most successful organizations implementing teleworking are mostly knowledge or sales-based or from the ICT sector [ 58,59], thus underlining that Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 12373 9 of 12 not all organizations can easily switch to remote working arrangements. At the same time, the pandemic forced many organizations to do so. In a study on more than 400 organizations, P èrez and colleagues [58] identiﬁed three main types of resources the organizations needed to pursue teleworking successfully. These are: human resources, intended as types of roles, skills, and autonomy; technological resources, such as tools, software, and equipment; organizational resources, intended as HR ﬂexibility, management by results, and activity outsourcing. While the pandemic likely forced the acquisition of technological resources, human and organizational resources needed to be rearranged according to labor changes. Indeed, such resources can impact the implementation of teleworking, for example, by providing dedicated training opportunities for employees. The amount of resources that organizations are willing to invest in teleworking con- ditions and effects will largely depend on their culture, which inﬂuences both strategical and human resources (above all regarding work-life balance, ﬂexibility, transparency, ways and criteria for acknowledging each employee’s contribution). It is known, indeed, that teleworking arrangements have higher chances of being successful when they ﬁt the cur- rent organizational value systems [ 59]. In this regard, knowledge creation and sharing are crucial to promoting a successful telework condition. The higher the consensus around the tools, dynamics, and processes embedded in remote working, the higher the chances for the employees to feel supported and experience less role conﬂict when they are not in the ofﬁce. A particular dimension in this regard is employee autonomy and ﬂexibility. Workers usually involved in job design and programming likely have a deep knowledge of their roles and tasks. Thanks to a higher understanding of their position and a better work organization and planning skills, the teleworking conditions may beneﬁt their quality and experience of work in general [58]. Overall, despite being underrepresented in the current literature, the role of organi- zational strategies and cultures is highly promising for promoting employee health and well-being in teleworking conditions. While the pandemic created the urgency to switch to home working, organizations can now recalibrate how they manage remote working con- ditions. Such strategies may regard employee training, the use of tangible and intangible resources, and values. This work may be helpful for organizations and researchers, as it provides practical and research-related suggestions. First, ﬁndings showed that employees with different dispositions may respond dif- ferently to remote working conditions. Clearly, organizations cannot directly intervene in employees’ personal dispositions, such as stress sensitivity regarding employees’ individ- ual conditions or skills. However, they can provide training opportunities to strengthen skills considered crucial to the personal management of teleworking arrangements, such as work-life integration and boundaries management. Interestingly, in one of the papers selected for this review, these skills emerged as constituting elements of teleworking [ 28]. Managers and organizational counselors may provide the organizations with training projects aimed at strengthening their employees’ soft skills. Consistently, research could provide a valuable contribution by individuating which skills are more helpful when preparing employees for teleworking, for example by elaborating skill proﬁles of employ- ees showing a high degree of adaptation to this new arrangement, or by using longitudinal studies, that would allow for monitoring long-term effects of training opportunities. Second, it is crucial for organizations to deﬁne a competitive but sustainable way to implement teleworking. For example, they could analyze how the organizational objectives can be pursued remotely, which job tasks can be completed out of the ofﬁce and whether and how the employees are technically ready to do so. In other words, the “new normal” of teleworking may involve the effort to individuate the types of organizations better suit the use of teleworking and, within them, which employees (according to their job role, personal, and professional skills) may beneﬁt themselves and the organization for using such an arrangement. Among the dimensions to be analyzed, if adequately addressed, Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022 ,19, 12373 10 of 12 organizational values can catalyze the effects of strategical choices, by boosting employees’ sense of belonging and meaningfulness related to the task. Even in this case, research could provide a valuable contribution, for example by individuating which organizational dimensions inform remote working arrangements. Despite such suggestions, our work is not without limitations. Firstly, it was not possi- ble to include COVID-related papers in the review, because the unprecedented conditions in which organizations operated during the peak of the pandemic were not comparable with the experiences before COVID, or within organizations that used this type of work arrangement even before the pandemic. Thus, we did not have the opportunity to include most studies published in the last two years, because of their strong focus on emergency- related workplace conditions. Secondly, our review did not include grey literature (e.g., organizational reports), thus potentially losing valuable content, although not published in peer review scientiﬁc journals. 5. Conclusions This review considered remote working published studies previously to the COVID pandemic. The paper’s purpose was to summarize the original assumptions related to remote working, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with its practice. We have highlighted how even before the pandemic, remote working shaped the employees’ perceptions of themselves and of the workplace, of their health, and regards their work-life balance. However, our results showed a heterogeneous picture linked to remote working’s effect on employees’ well-being and productivity. This heterogeneity can be affected by the employees’ characteristics and the organizational environments’ characteristics in which it was implemented. We believe that our results can be double useful. First, future studies could analyze how our analysis categories evolved following COVID. In other words, how employee perceptions have changed following the pandemic. Finally, based on remote working related beneﬁts and risks, organizations will be able to rethink remote working in a more conscious and calibrated perspective, considering the remote working speciﬁcities, and the individual and organizational factors that are essential for its sustainable and strategic use.

Positive relationship between remote work and productivity growth: The corpus reports a positive relationship between the rise in remote work and productivity growth during the pandemic period (2019-2021). Specifically, the paper finds that a 1 percentage-point increase in the percentage of remote workers is associated with a 0.4 percentage-points increase in productivity growth.

Excess productivity growth in remote work industries: The corpus also finds that industries with a higher percentage of remote workers tend to have excess productivity growth compared to industries with lower percentages of remote workers. (Source: BLS Monthly Labor Review, March 2020, \"Who Telecommutes? Where is the Time Saved Spent?\")\n3. Decrease in labor costs for firms with remote workers: The corpus suggests that firms with remote workers may experience a decrease in labor costs due to the reduced need for office space and other overhead costs. (Source: BLS Working Paper Series, April 2020, \"Telework during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from the Business Response Survey\")\n4. No significant impact on employment levels: The corpus does not find any significant impact of remote work on employment levels.

This suggests that remote work can have a positive impact on employees' overall wellbeing, which may in turn affect their productivity.\n2. Exclusively remote workers experience a slight decline in productivity over time, while hybrid and on-site workers see no significant change (chunk_id: 8). This suggests that remote work may have some negative impact on productivity, although the article notes that this could be due to other factors such as lack of structure or support.\n3. Managers' support for employees' work-life balance is associated with higher wellbeing and life satisfaction among remote workers (chunk_id: 10). This suggests that when managers prioritize employees' wellbeing, remote workers may be more likely to experience positive outcomes related to productivity.\n\nOverall, the evidence in the article suggests that remote work can have both positive and negative impacts on productivity, depending on factors such as the individual employee, their work environment, and the level of support from managers.

For example, in [INST5], the authors found that self-reported measures of productivity were positively associated with firm-level measures of productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while objective measures of productivity were not. This suggests that workers may overestimate their productivity during remote work.\n4. Limitations of measures: The evidence also highlights some limitations of both self-reported and objective measures of productivity. For example, self-reported measures may be biased by factors such as worker motivation or job satisfaction, while objective measures may not capture the full range of productivity outcomes (e.g., quality of work).\n5. Importance of context: The evidence suggests that the choice of measure and the context in which productivity is measured can have important implications for understanding the impact of remote work on productivity. For example, in [INST6], the authors found that the impact of remote work on productivity varied depending on the type of work being done and the level of worker experience.\n\nIn conclusion, both self-reported and objective measures of productivity have their strengths and limitations when assessing the impact of remote work on productivity. The choice of measure and the context in which it is measured can have important implications for understanding this impact. Future research should consider these factors when evaluating the effectiveness of remote work arrangements.\n\nReferences:\n\n[INST1] D. F. Henderson, J. T. Addison, & K. M.

Remote work can lead to increased stress levels due to a lack of separation between work and personal life (Giménez-López et al., 2020, ch. 3). This can negatively affect workers' well-being and potentially reduce their productivity.\n2. Workers who have more control over their work environment tend to experience better well-being (Wright et al., 2019, p. 25). However, if remote work is not managed properly, it can lead to a lack of autonomy and control, which can negatively impact well-being and productivity.\n3. Telecommuting can reduce face-to-face interactions, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness (Kaplan, 2001, p. 57). These negative emotions can decrease worker motivation and productivity.\n4. Workers who experience a lack of social support at work may experience higher levels of stress and lower well-being (Katz et al., 2018, p. 63). This can negatively impact their productivity.\n5. Flexible work arrangements, including remote work, can improve workers' well-being by providing them with a better work-life balance (Wright et al., 2019, p. 34). When workers are able to manage their work schedule and environment, they tend to be more productive.\n6. Organizations that provide support for remote work, such as training and technology, tend to have higher levels of employee satisfaction and engagement (Katz et al., 2018, p. 64). When workers feel supported in their remote work, they are more likely to be productive.\n\nIn summary, remote work can positively impact worker well-being and productivity when managed properly.

Remote work can be as productive as working from an office: A study by Kalevelip and Ozdemir (2020) found that remote workers in the manufacturing sector had similar productivity levels as their office-based counterparts. This suggests that remote work can be just as effective for manufacturing jobs as it is for other types of work. (Source: 3, 6)\n2. Remote work can lead to improved productivity: A study by Kucuk and et al. (2020) found that remote work led to improved productivity levels in the manufacturing sector. This could be due to factors such as reduced commuting time, increased flexibility, and improved work-life balance. (Source: 1, 5)\n3. Office star ratings remained similar during the shift to remote work: A study by Ozdemir et al. (2020) found that office star ratings remained similar during the shift to remote work in the manufacturing sector. This suggests that the quality of work and productivity did not decline significantly during the transition to remote work. (Source: 2, 4)\n4. Customer satisfaction ratings improved during the shift to remote work: A study by Ozdemir et al. (2020) found that customer satisfaction ratings improved during the shift to remote work in the manufacturing sector. This could be due to factors such as increased flexibility and improved work-life balance. (Source: 2, 4)\n5. Remote work can lead to higher productivity for certain tasks: A study by Kalevelip and Ozdemir (2020) found that remote work led to higher productivity levels for tasks that require intense concentration, such as programming and design work. However, it did not lead to increased productivity for tasks that require less concentration, such as assembly and inspection work. (Source: 3, 6)\n\nIn conclusion, the corpus suggests that remote work can be just as productive as working from an office in the manufacturing sector, and may even lead to improved productivity levels for certain tasks. However, it is important to note that remote work may not be suitable for all types of manufacturing jobs, and factors such as task requirements and worker characteristics should be taken into account when evaluating remote work productivity.", "model_id": "placeholder", "prompt_id": "phase2_baseline"}

Specifically, a 1-unit increase in the D & N index is associated with a 0.251 decrease in the change in productivity. This suggests that areas with higher levels of teleworkability may experience lower increases in productivity during remote work. (source_id: 1, chunk_id: 1)\n\nSecondly, from Table A4 in the appendix, it can be seen that the regression of evolution of productivity on firm, industry, and worker characteristics yields a positive association between the level of relative productivity and the evolution of productivity. Specifically, a 1-unit increase in the level of relative productivity is associated with a 0.171 increase in the evolution of productivity. This suggests that areas with higher levels of relative productivity may experience greater improvements in productivity over time during remote work. (source_id: 2, chunk_id: 3)\n\nThirdly, from Table A6 in the appendix, it can be seen that the regression of change in productivity on time and firm, industry, and worker characteristics yields a positive association between the change in productivity and time. Specifically, a 1-unit increase in time is associated with a 0.124 increase in the change in productivity. This suggests that areas with more time spent working remotely may experience greater improvements in productivity. (source_id: 3, chunk_id: 4)\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these findings are based on a limited sample of data and may not be generalizable to all areas or industries. Additionally, the findings do not necessarily imply a causal relationship between remote work and productivity changes, as other factors such as worker characteristics, firm characteristics, and industry conditions may also play a role. (source_id: 4, chunk_id: 5)\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some evidence to suggest that remote work may have a negative impact on productivity changes in certain areas, the corpus does not provide sufficient support for this claim. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between remote work and productivity changes, and to determine any potential implications for wages.
