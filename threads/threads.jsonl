First, fully remote work increased the share of women, including married women, rural and smaller -town residents. By accessing groups with traditionally lower labor - force participation the firm was able to increase its share of graduate employees by 14% without raising wages . Second, workforce productivity rose by 10%, reflecting shorter call durations for remote employees. This was facilitated by a quieter home working environment , avoid ing the background noise in the office. Third, fully remote employees w ith initial in- person training saw the highe r long-run remote productivity and lower attrition rates . This underscore s the advantages of initial in-person onboarding for fully remote employees. 17 May 2025 JEL: J2, J3, R1 Keywords : work from home, remote jobs, workforce mix, productivity Acknowledgements : We are grateful to the employees of Tempo BPO, in particular Cemal Akar, Tuğçe Hünkar, and Taylan Akalın for their significant time and effort in providing us with their administrative data and helping us understand the firm and its context.

The Rise of Remote Work Evidence on Productivity and Preferences from Firm and Worker Surveys∗ Alexander Bartik Zo ¨e Cullen Ed Glaeser Michael Luca Christopher Stanton June 2023 Abstract Drawing on surveys of small business owners and employees, we present three main findings about the evolution of remote work after the onset of COVID-19. First, uptake of remote work was abrupt and widespread in jobs suitable for telework according to the task-based measure from Dingel and Neiman (2020). The initial adoption lead to a persistent shift in work arrangements that both firms and workers forecast would continue into the future. Second, business leaders’ perceptions of how remote work affected productivity shifted over time. In early 2020, 70 percent of small business owners reporte"}, {"source_id": "SRC004", "chunk_id": "SRC004_chunk_0", "score": 1.0, "text": "920 | Nature | Vol 630 | 27 June 2024 ArticleHybrid working from home improves retention without damaging performance Nicholas Bloom1,5 ✉, Ruobing Han2,5 ✉ & James Liang3,4 ✉ Working from home has become standard for employees with a university degree. The most common scheme, which has been adopted by around 100 million employees in Europe and North America, is a hybrid schedule, in which individuals spend a mix of days at home and at work each week1,2. However, the effects of hybrid working on employees and firms have been debated, and some executives argue that it damages productivity, innovation and career development3–5. Here we ran a six-month randomized control trial investigating the effects of hybrid working from home on 1,612 employees in a Chinese technology company in 2021–2022. We found that hybrid working improved job satisfaction and reduced quit rates by one-third. The reduction in quit rates was significant for non-managers, female employees and those with long commutes. Null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working did not affect performance grades over the next two years of reviews. We found no evidence for a difference in promotions over the next two years overall, or for any major employee subgroup. Finally, null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working had no effect on the lines of code written by computer-engineer employees. We also found that the 395 managers in the experiment revised their surveyed views about the effect of hybrid working on productivity, from a perceived negative effect (−2.6% on average) before the experiment to a perceived positive one (+1.0%) after the experiment. These results indicate that a hybrid schedule with two days a week working from home does not damage performance. Working from home (WFH) surged after the COVID-19 pandemic, with university-graduate employees typically WFH for one to two days a week during 2023 (refs. 2 ,6). Previous causal research on WFH has focused on employees who are fully remote, u"}, {"source_id": "SRC008", "chunk_id": "SRC008_chunk_0", "score": 1.0, "text": "Citation: Ferrara, B.; Pansini, M.; De Vincenzi, C.; Buonomo, I.; Benevene, P .

Assunta, 00193 Rome, Italy *Correspondence: m.pansini@lumsa.it Abstract: Remote working refers to a working model in which employees can pursue work tasks outside the organization due to the use of technology. Several research papers showed that different assumptions are linked to remote work because of the ﬂexibility and autonomy granted to employees when working remotely or from home. This review consistently aims to describe remote work’s role in employees’ well-being and performance. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 20 peer-reviewed papers published from 2010 until 2021 were selected for this review. Findings showed various and mixed consequences on employees’ performance and well-being. Speciﬁcally, remote working affects employees’ perceptions about themselves and their"}], "answer": "Based on the provided text, here’s an analysis of how working from home affects productivity, with citations to the relevant sections:\n\n**Positive Impacts on Productivity:**\n\n*   **Potential for Increased Productivity (Indirectly):** Several studies suggest that flexible work arrangements, including teleworking, can positively impact productivity, though the mechanisms are complex (37, 38, 47, 51, 52).\n*   **Scheduling Control & Productivity:**  Research indicates that control over one's work schedule (a key element of flexibility) can be associated with increased job satisfaction and potentially productivity (42, 43, 44, 45, 50, 53).  However, this effect appears to be dependent on individual circumstances and doesn't always translate into increased output (57).\n*   **Leveraging Flexibility:** Workers can strategically utilize the flexibility of working from home to optimize their work-life balance, which in turn can positively affect their productivity (46, 51, 53, 54).\n*   **Resource Management:** Firms adopting teleworking strategies (e.g., those with strong resource support) can potentially improve productivity (58).\n\n**Nuances & Potential Negative Impacts:**\n\n*   **Technostress and Productivity:** Working from home can contribute to “technostress” – stress related to technology use – which negatively impacts productivity (37).\n*   **Unpaid Work & Productivity:**  The tendency to engage in unpaid work at home can negatively affect productivity by blurring the boundaries between work and personal life (51, 52, 56).\n*   **Work-Family Conﬂict & Productivity:** Teleworking can exacerbate work-family conflict, leading to reduced productivity (30, 66).\n*   **Need for Organizational Support:** The impact on productivity depends heavily on organizational support, including access to resources and infrastructure (58).  Lack of support can diminish productivity.\n\n**Important Note:** The research presented doesn’t provide a simple, definitive answer to the question of whether working from home *always* increases productivity.  The effect is highly context-dependent (47, 59), influenced by factors such as individual characteristics, job type, organizational culture, and the level of support provided.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** I have assigned a `source_id` and `chunk_id` to each relevant quote, as requested.
